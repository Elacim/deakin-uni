##### Q1) Light travels from air into glass as shown below:
%% [[Snell's Law of Refraction]] %%

![[Quiz 5 - Q1.png]]
a. $\frac{\sin(80\degree)}{\sin(30\degree)}$
b. $\frac{\sin(30\degree)}{\sin(80\degree)}$
c. $\frac{\sin(10\degree)}{\sin(60\degree)}$
d. $\frac{\sin(60\degree)}{\sin(10\degree)}$
I'm not entirely sure what I'm trying to figure out here, I'm going to assume $n_{2}$.

I believe $\theta_{1} = 90-30 = 60\degree$. At this point, the answer could be **c** or **d**.
We know that the angle of refraction is $\theta_{2} = 90-80 = 10\degree$.

$n_{1}\sin(\theta_{1}) = n_{2}\sin(\theta_{2})$

$1.0 \times \sin(60\degree) = n_{2} \times \sin(10\degree)$
-> $\sin(60\degree) = n_{2} \times \sin(10\degree)$
-> $\frac{\sin(60\degree)}{\sin(10\degree)} = n_{2}$
$n_{2} = \frac{\sin(60\degree)}{\sin(10\degree)}$



##### Q2) A light ray reflects from a surface. If the angle of incidence is 29°, what is the angle between the reflected ray and the incident ray at the surface?
%% [[Law of Reflection]] %%
a. 58.00
b. 14.50
c. 29.00
d. 61.00

When reflecting, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.
We want the sum of both of these angles.
$29\degree + 29\degree = 58\degree$

##### Q3) A 0.6 cm object is placed 4 cm from a converging lens (focal length = 3 cm). True or false: The image formed will be upright. 
False. [[Converging lenses]] 

$h_{o} = 0.6$cm, $d_{o} = 4$cm, $f = 3$cm
$\frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{d_{i}}$
-> $\frac{4}{12} - \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{d_{i}}$
-> $\frac{1}{12}^{-1} = d_{i}$
-> $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{12}}$
-> $\frac{1}{\frac{12}{1}}$
$d_{i} = 12$cm ($+$ means it is a real image and appears after the lens)

$m = -\frac{12}{0.6}$
$= -20\times$ magnification ($-$ means it will appear upside down)


$h_{i} = mh$
-> $-20 \times 0.6$
$= -12$cm

It will appear upside down

##### Q4) For someone who is hypermetropic, which position best represents where the image of a distant object is focused? 
%% [[Hyperopia (hypermetropic)]] %%
![[Quiz 5 - Q4 and 5.png|200]]
Position **E**


##### Q5) For someone who is myopic, which position best represents where the image of a distant object is focused?
![[Quiz 5 - Q4 and 5.png|200]]
Position **C**

##### Q6) A 3.0 cm tall object is placed along the principal axis of a thin converging lens of 30.0 cm focal length. If the object distance is 40.0 cm, which of the following best describes the image distance and height, respectively? 
a. 17.3 cm and 7.0 cm
b. 120 cm and ‐9.0 cm
c. 17.3 cm and 1.3 cm
d. 120 cm and ‐1.0 cm
e. 120 cm and 7 cm

$d_{o} = 40$cm, $f = 30$cm, $h = 3$cm

**Distance to the image**
$\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_{o}} + \frac{1}{d_{i}}$
-> $\frac{1}{30} = \frac{1}{40} + \frac{1}{d_{i}}$
-> $\frac{1}{120} = \frac{1}{d_{i}}$
-> $d_{i} = \frac{1}{120}^{-1}$
$d_{i} = 120$cm to the image

**Magnification of the image**
$m = - \frac{d_{i}}{d_{o}}$ 
-> $-\frac{120}{40} = -3\times$ magnification

**Image height**
$h' = mh$
-> $-3 \times 3$
$= -9$cm

##### Q7) A light beam travelling in air hits water at an angle of 45º (refractive index air = 1 and water = 1.33). What is the angle of refraction in degrees?
%% [[Snell's Law of Refraction]] %%
$\theta_{1} = 90-45 = 45\degree$
$n_{1} = 1.0$
$n_{2} = 1.33$
$\theta_{2} = ?$

$\theta_{2} = \arcsin(\frac{n_{1}\sin(\theta_{1})}{n_2})$
-> $\theta_{2} = \arcsin(\frac{1.0\sin(45\degree)}{1.33})$
-> $\theta_{2} = 0.5605 \times \frac{\pi}{180}$
$\theta_{2} = 32.12\degree$


##### Q8) A light ray in air (n = 1.00) hits carbon disulfide (n = 1.63) at an angle of 64° to the normal. Determine the angle of refraction. 
%% [[Snell's Law of Refraction]] %%
$\theta_{1} = 90-64 = 26\degree$
$n_{1} = 1.0$
$n_{2} = 1.63$
$\theta_{2} = ?$

$\theta_{2} = \arcsin(\frac{n_{1}\sin(\theta_{1})}{n_2})$
-> $\arcsin(\frac{1.0\sin(26)}{1.63})$
-> $= 0.2722916437 \times \frac{180}{\pi}$
$\theta_{2} = 15.60\degree$

##### Q9) An object is 21 cm in front of a converging lens with a focal length of 9 cm. Use the lens equation to determine the location of the image in meters.

$\frac{1}{9} = \frac{1}{21} + \frac{1}{d_{i}}$
-> $\frac{21}{189} - \frac{9}{189} = \frac{1}{d_{i}}$
-> $d_{i} = \frac{12}{189}^{-1}$
$d_{i} = 15.75$cm $= 0.1575$m
