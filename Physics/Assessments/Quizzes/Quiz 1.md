##### Q1 - A ship sails 4 km due north and then 7 km due west in 6 hours.  What is the ships’s average velocity in km / hr ?
$\frac{7-4}{6-0} = 0.5$km/hr

xi = 0
xf = $\sqrt{4^{2} + 7^{2}} = 8.0622$
ti = 0
tf = 6 hours

$\frac{x_{f} - x_{i}}{t_{f} - t_{i}}$
-> $\frac{8.0622-0}{6-0}$
-> $v = 1.34$km/hr



##### Q2 - A train can accelerate from rest to 5 m s-1 in 2 seconds. What is the acceleration of the train in m s-2?


##### Q3 - What is the correct unit for the magnitude (size) of force?
$\ce{kg ms^{-2}}$

##### Q4 - The correct standard notation for the number 0.005 830  is
$5.83 \times 10^{-3}$

##### Q5 - Car vroom acceleration
- [[Newton's Second Law]]
- [[Acceleration]] 
A car of mass 7 kg accelerates on a straight, flat, horizontal road.   
The driving force _F_ of 800 N on the car is opposed by a resistive
force of 500 N. The acceleration of the car in m s-2 is...?

Net force $=300N$
$300N = 7\ce{kg} \times a$
-> $\frac{300}{7} = 42.86$ $\ce{m/s^{2}}$


##### Q6 - Airplane shruosh
The pilot of a cruising Airplane increases the force of its engines by $79,127N$ to push the plane forward; whilst the combined wind and air friction force in the opposite direction are $35,512 N$.
The plane has a mass of $209,677$ kg
Determine the magnitude of the resulting acceleration(m  s-2) of the airplane.

$\ce{Net force} = 79127 - 35512 = 43,615N$
-> $43,615 = 209,677 \times a$
-> $\frac{43,615}{209,677} = a$
-> $a = 0.208$ $\ce{m/s^{2}}$


###### Q7 - Aeroplane velocity after 4 minutes
If the initial velocity of the plane is 225 m s-1 and acceleration is 3.4 m s-2, what will be its velocity(m s-1) after 4 minute?

Knowns: 
- vi = 225
- a = 3.4 $\ce{m/s^{2}}$
- t = 4 minutes = 360s
Unknown:
- vf = ?

$v_{f} = v_{i} + at$
-> $v_{f} = 225 + 3.4(360)$
-> $v_{f} = 1449$$\ce{m/s^{-1}}$

##### Q8 - Aeroplane distance
If the initial velocity of the plane is 238 m s-1 and acceleration is 0.5 m s-2, how far(in metres) will it have travelled after 21 seconds?

Knowns:
- vi = 238
- a = 0.5
- t = 21
Unknown:
- d = ?

$\Delta x = v_{i}t + \frac{1}{2}at^{2}$
-> $238 * 21 + \frac{1}{2}*0.5*21^2$
-> $= 5108.25$m


##### Q9 - Rubber on concrete
Rubber on concrete has a static friction co-efficient of 1.6.    
A 1.9 kg rubber block is pushed from rest along concrete.  What is the minimum force (N) that the ball must be pushed with for it to begin accelerating (correct to 2 decimal places)?
- [[Friction]] 

Rubber block: $F = 1.9\ce{kg} \times 9.8$
-> $18.62N$

$f_{s} = 18.62 * 1.6 = 29.792N$


##### Q10 - Car acceleration
A 1164 kg car can accelerate with 6 m s-2. What is the net force(N) on the car?
$F = ma$
-> $1164 * 6$
-> $F = 6984N$


##### Q11 - Car acceleration then slowdown
A car accelerates constantly from rest and reaches a velocity of 23 m s-1 after 2 seconds, and then travels at constant speed of 23 m s-1 for 47 seconds. Then, it slows at a constant acceleration (decelerates)  to 0 m s-1 in 14 seconds.
What is the total distance travelled in metres?

**Triangle 1**
$\frac{1}{2} * 23 * 2 = 23$

**Rectangle**
$23 * 47 = 1081$

**Triangle 2**
$\frac{1}{2} * 23 * 14 = 161$

**Total**
$23 + 1081 + 161 = 1265$m travelled

##### Q12 - Deceleration over 7 seconds
A car slows at a constant acceleration (decelerates) from 18 m s-1 to 0 m s-1 in 7 seconds.
 What is the magnitude of the final deceleration(m s-2)?
- [[Acceleration]] 

$a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v_{f} - v_{i}}{t_{f} - t_{i}}$ 

$\frac{0-18}{7-0} = -2.57$$\ce{m s^{2}}$


##### Q13 - Explain the difference between **scalar** and **vector** quantities. Give one example for each.
Scalar quantities are singular values like 1.5 or -6.0. 
Vectors are dual values, one representing the strength and the other representing the direction. 
The main difference is scalars are directionless whereas vectors have a direction.

A scalar may be something like a vehicle accelerating by 5 $\ce{m/s^{2}}$.
Continuing the vehicle example, a vector would be a vehicle driving with a velocity of 10 $\ce{m/s^{2}}$ North-East.
