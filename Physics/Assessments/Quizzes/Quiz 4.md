#### Q1) A +10 C charge exerts a force on an electron that is...
**a. Attractive and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the charges**
b. Attractive and directly proportional to the square of the distance between the charges
c. Repulsive and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the charges
d. Repulsive and directly proportional to the square of the distance between the charges

Using [[Coulomb's Law]] where $F = K \frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r^{2}}$ I determined that if the distance is increased, the charge decreases, meaning it must be inversely proportional. 
Also, coulomb's law is known as an inverse square law.

### Q2) What is the magnitude of the electric field strength at 4 m from a 2 C charge (K=coulomb’s constant)?
Electric field magnitude :: $E = \frac{F}{q} = \frac{Kq}{r^{2}}$ (N/C)

$E = K \frac{2}{4^{2}}$
-> $K \frac{2}{16}$
-> $K \frac{1}{8}$
$= \frac{K}{8}$


### Q3) Which of the three right-hand charges experiences the largest force?
![[Quiz 4 - Q3.png]]
1. $F = \frac{Qq}{(r)^{2}} = \frac{Qq}{r^{2}}$
2. $F = \frac{Q2q}{(2r)^{2}} = \frac{2Qq}{4r^{2}} = \frac{Qq}{2r^{2}}$. This'd be the smallest force felt.
3. $F = \frac{Q4q}{(2r)^{2}} = \frac{4Qq}{4r^{2}} = \frac{Qq}{r^{2}}$

1 and 3 are equally large.


### Q4) As two like charges move close to each other, the electrical potential energy of each charge...
**a. increases**
b. decreases
c. remains constant
d. becomes zero

### Q5) Suppose a region of space has a uniform electric field, directed toward the right, as shown in the figure. Which statement is true?
![[Quiz 4 - Q5.png]]

**Likely: a. The voltage at points A and B are equal, and the voltage at point C is lower than the voltage at point A.**
- There is less potential energy and voltage where the arrows in an electric field point.
- Also, A and B have equal voltages as they are on the same line that is perpendicular to the field direction. 

Less likely: b. The voltage at points **A** and **B** are equal, and the voltage at point **C** is higher than the voltage at point **A**.

No: c. The voltage at point **A** is the highest, the voltage at point **B** is the second highest, and the voltage at point **C** is the lowest.

No: d. The voltage at all three locations is the same.


### Q6)  The electrical force between two objects depends on...
**a. the distance between the two objects and the charge of the two objects.**
b. the distance between the two objects and the mass of the two objects.
c. the mass of the two objects and the charge of the two objects.
d. the mass of the two objects

### Q7) The diagram shows equipotential lines due to two objects. The two objects could be...
![[Quiz 4 - Q7.png|200]]
a. electric charges of the opposite sign only  
**b. electric charges of the same sign only**  
c. electric charges of same masses  
d. electric charges of same momentum

### Q8) Determine the magnitude of the electrostatic force( in N) on positive charge q2 ($3\mu C$) if it is 6 m away from positive charge q1 ($6\mu C$).
$3 \mu C = \frac{3}{1,000,000} = 0.000003$
$6 \mu C = \frac{6}{1,000,000} = 0.000006$

$9 \times 10^{9} \frac{ 0.000003 \times 0.000006 }{ 6^{2} }$
-> $(9 \times 10^{9}) \times (5 \times 10^{-13} )$
-> $45 \times 10^{-4}$
$=4.5 \times 10^{-3} = 0.0045$N


### Q9) The electric field strength of a cell membrane is about $10^{9}$ N/C.  
(charge of a proton = 1.60 × 10e–19 C and proton mass = 1.67 ×10e–27 kg)
##### a) What is the electrical force on a hydrogen ion (proton) at the membrane?

$E = \frac{F}{q}$
$10^{9} = \frac{F}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}}$
-> $F = 10^{9} \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19}$
-> $F = 10^{9-19} \times 1.6$
$F = 1.6 \times 10^{-10}$

##### b) Calculate the acceleration of a hydrogen ion across a cell membrane.
$F = ma$
-> $1.6 \times 10^{-10} = 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \times a$
-> $\frac{1.6 \times 10^{-10}}{1.67 \times 10^{-27}} = a$
$a = 9.58 \times 10^{16}$ $\ce{m/s^{2}}$


### Q10) Explain the difference between a _conductor_ and an _insulator_; give one example of each type of material.
A conductor allows electric charges to flow through it whereas insulators limit the movement of charges. The flow rate of charges in conductors and the level of movement limiting of charges in insulators depends on the material. Specifically, the factor separating these two is the resistivity of a given material .

Metals like iron can be conductors as they have a 'sea of electrons' which readily shift from atom to atom therefore transporting a charge. This transportation happens when an electric field acts on the conductor. A positive charge would pull the electrons from the conductor and go with the electric field while a negative charge would push the electrons away from the conductor and go against the electric field. Both of these would be dependent on if the charge is strong enough to overcome the electric field.
Solutions like water with ions can also be conductors. 

Rubber is a strong insulator. Same with plastics which are used to insulate electrical wires, preventing their charges from exiting the wires.
