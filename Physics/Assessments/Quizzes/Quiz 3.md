##### 1) Two waves with equal negative amplitudes travel on a rope toward each other as shown in the figure below. What is the result when the waves reach the same point?
Constructive interference with double amplitude

##### 2) Which of these electromagnetic waves has the highest frequency?
X-ray

##### 3) The frequency of this wave is...
![[Quiz 3 - Q3.png]]

$v = f \lambda$
$1\ce{m/s}$ $= f\times 2\ce{m}$
$\frac{1}{2} = f$
$f = 0.5$Hz

##### 4) Light travels at 3.0 × 10^8 m/s. If the wavelength is 175 m, what is the frequency in Hz?
$v = f\lambda$, $f = \frac{v}{\lambda}$
$\frac{3.0 \times 10^{8}}{175\ce{m}} = 1,714,285.714$ Hz

##### 5) Compared to a sound of 50 decibels, a sound of 70 decibels is:
%% [[Sound intensity and loudness]]  %%
$I = 10^{\frac{50 + log_{10}(1.0 \times 10^{-12})}{10}} = 6309.57$
-> $70$ decibels $=630957.34$
$\frac{630957.34448019}{6309.5734448019} = 100$ times more intense

##### 6) Two wave pulses on a string approach each other at speeds of 1m/s. How does the string look at $t=3$s?
![[Quiz 3 - Q6.png]]
Rectangle house with triangle roof, a

##### 7)
![[Quiz 3 - Q7.png]]

Likely a.
Not b as they would not cancel.
Not c as there is more rectangle than triangle and therefore isn't negative.
d would be the result if the triangle was instead looking like a.

##### 8) Figure shows a wave going 7 $\ce{m/s^{2}}$. What is the wavelength (in metres)?
![[Quiz 3 - Q8.png]]

$7$ $\ce{m/s^{2}}$ $= \frac{\lambda}{1.2}$
-> $\lambda = 8.4$m

or
$f = \frac{1}{T}$
-> $\frac{1}{1.2\ce{s}} = 0.8333$
$\lambda = \frac{v}{f}$
-> $7$ $\ce{m/s^{2}}$ $\div$ $0.833$
$\lambda = 8.4$m

##### 9) What is the period in seconds?
![[Quiz 3 - Q9.png]]
Period = 2 minutes = 120s

##### 10) For this sinusoidal wave, what is the frequency(in hertz)?
![[Quiz 3 - Q10.png]]

$v=f\lambda$, $f=\frac{v}{\lambda}$
$f = \frac{200}{2}$
-> $100$ Hz

##### 11) An ambulance is generating a siren sound at a frequency of 2979 Hz. If an observer is traveling 16 m/s away from the stationary ambulance, calculate the frequency(in Hz) of the siren perceived by the observer (velocity of sound = 343 m/s)
Stationary source, observer moving away
%% [[Doppler effect]] %%
$f_{+} = \left( 1 - \frac{v_{0}}{v} \right)f_{s}$
$= \left(1- \frac{16}{343}\right)\times 2979\ce{Hz}$
-> $0.950 \times 2979$
$= 2831.35$ Hz

##### 12) The diagram on the right the shows the waves superimposed to produce the resultant wave. Describe the type of interference shown.
![[Quiz 3 - Q12.png]]
Destructive interference. When superimposed, these two waves perfectly add together to equal zero at every point. e.g. at about x=450, wave 1 is at it's highest y-value at +1 whereas wave 2 is at it's lowest y-value, -1.
e.g. +1 + -1 = 0; +0.432 + -0.432 = 0
Assuming the waves are continuous, this destructive interference could theoretically go on forever. 

##### 13) Explain the difference between a **_Transverse wave and Longitudinal wave_** and give one example of each type of wave.
%%
[[Longitudinal waves]] 
[[Transverse waves]] 
%%
These types of waves refer to the direction of particle and field propagation. 

Transverse waves and longitudinal waves both travel in the same direction, the difference being that transverse waves oscillate perpendicularly to their direction of travel.

A sound wave is an example of a longitudinal wave as it compresses particles and leaves stretched regions, which are characteristic of longitudinal waves.

All electromagnetic waves are transverse waves as they have an oscillating light wave with an electric field oscillating perpendicular to it. Another example is ripples of water, where the water particles oscillates up and down perpendicular to the direction of travel (e.g. outwards)
