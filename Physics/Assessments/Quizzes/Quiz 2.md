##### Q1) A positive buoyant force acting on an object in a fluid results in the object...
%%[[Buoyancy]]%% 
Floating
##### Q2) The average density of 4 g of salt in a liquid occupying 429 cm3 in kgm-3 is...
%% [[Density]] %%
$429 \ce{cm}^{3} \times 10^{-6} = 0.000429 \ce{m^{3}}$
$4g = \frac{4}{1000} = 0.004kg$

$\frac{0.004}{0.000429} = 9.32 \ce{kg m^{3}}$


##### Q3) A form of matter that consists of atoms/molecules that move relative to each other, but remain in contact, is a...
Liquid

##### Q4) A spring stretches by 10 cm when a 7 N object is attached. What is the magnitude of the spring constant in N/m? 2 decimal places.
%% [[Elastic (spring) potential energy]] %%
$10\ce{cm} \xrightarrow{\ce{metres}} 0.1\ce{m}$
$F = -k \Delta x$
-> $7\ce{N} = -k \times 0.1\ce{m}$
-> $\frac{7\ce{N}}{0.1\ce{m}} = -k$
$k = -70.00\ce{ N/m}$

##### Q5) A 1 kg ball sits on the fifth platform of the Deakin College tower, 9 m above the ground. What is its gravitational potential energy in Joules with respect to the ground?
$U_{g} = mgh$
-> $U_{g} = 1\ce{kg} \times  9.81 \times 9\ce{m}$
$U_{g} = 88.29$ joules


##### Q6) Determine the change in kinetic energy (J) of a 1123 kg car moving with a speed of 15 m s-1.
%% [[Kinetic energy]] %%
$K = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$
-> $K= \frac{1}{2} * 1123\ce{kg} * 15\ce{m s^{-1}}$
$K=8422.5$ joules
Oops, don't forget to square the $15$

##### Q7) Determine the average power output (Watts) of the car having kinetic energy of 28195 J in 10 seconds.
[[Work and heat (Energy transfer)]] 
$\ce{power = \frac{work}{time} = \frac{energy}{time} = \frac{F \times d}{time}}$
$\frac{28,195\ce{J}}{10\ce{s}} = 2819.5$ watts

##### Q8) A house has mass 15228 kg, which stands evenly on a slab that has dimension 22 m Ã— 16 m. Calculate the pressure exerted on the ground in pascal.
%% [[Pressure]], [[Pressure#Pressure comparisons]] %%
Area = $22\ce{m} \times 16\ce{m} = 352\ce{m^{2}}$
$F = 15,228\ce{kg} \times 9.81$ $\ce{m/s^{2}}$
-> $149386.68\ce{N}$

$\ce{Pa}=\frac{F}{A}$ (Force in N / Area in m^2)
-> $\frac{149,386.68\ce{N}}{352\ce{m^{2}}}$
$= 424.394$ pascals

##### Q9) A person has mass 6 kg and stands on the ground on two legs with shoes that have a total sole area of 27 cm2. Calculate the pressure exerted on the ground in pascal.
$F = 6\ce{kg} \times 9.81$ $\ce{ms^{2}}$ $= 58.86$ N
$A = \frac{27}{100} = 0.27\ce{m}$

$\ce{pascals} = \frac{58.86}{0.27*2}$
$= 109$ pascals

##### Q10) What would be the difference in blood pressure (in pascal) due to gravity, from the top of the head to the heart where the height difference is 37 cm from head to heart? (The density of blood is 1060 kg m-3.)
%% [[Gauge pressure]] %%
$37$cm = $0.37$m
$\rho g h$
$1060 \times 9.81 \times 0.37 = 3847.482$ pascals

##### Q11) What would be the total pressure experienced by a diver at a depth of 7 m in pascal? 
Note: (The atmospheric pressure is 1.013 x 10^5 Pa and density of water is 1000 kg m-3)
$\rho g h$
-> $1000 \times 9.81 \times 7\ce{m}$
$= 68670$ pascals

$68,670 + 101,300 = 169,970$ pascals

##### Q12) A group of muscles acts like a spring with spring constant 100000 N/m and is initially stretched to 0.1 mm from its resting length. What force (in newtons) is initially stretched the muscles?
%% [[Elastic (spring) potential energy]] %%
$\frac{0.1\ce{mm}}{1000} = 0.0001$ metres
$F = -kx$
-> $F = -100,000 * 0.0001$
$F = -10$ newtons

##### Q13) Explain the energy transformation that occurs during photosynthesis on a green leaf.
%% [[Energy transformations]] %%
Photons, electromagnetic energy, are absorbed into chlorophyll pigments. This photon energy is used to excite pigment electrons which split water and provide energy to store chemical potential energy as ATP through conversion of ADP to ATP. The water's electrons are also used to replenish the pigment electrons and to reduce the low energy NADPH+ into high chemical potential energy NADPH.
The NADPH and ATP release their energy, eventually forming glucose molecules which have high chemical potential energy bonds, used as energy storage for the plant's cells. 

Throughout these shifts in energy types, there would likely be small losses in energy as thermal energy. There may also be minor chemical -> kinetic energy conversion during these processes, especially during the splitting of the water.

****

Photons from the sun, electromagnetic energy, excite pigments which through their excited electrons, hydrolyse water into H_2 and 1/2 O_2. This releases thermal energy and two of their electrons, electrical energy, to the pigments and is also used to create chemical potential energy in the form of the high-energy ATP molecule that cells can use. A strong oxidising energy molecule, NADPH+ is reduced to form NADPH. The chemical potential energy in this hydrogen bond and ATP molecules is used to join three G3P molecules to form glucose, a stable molecule with a high chemical potential energy.
