_**Part 2: The report**_  
The report must give short answers to the following questions:

**1.** What is the claim or conclusion in your Experimental Demonstration?  
A claim is a statement of a student’s understanding of a phenomenon or the results of an investigation:  
- A one-sentence answer to the question you investigated.
- It answers, what can you conclude?
- It should not start with yes or no.
- It should describe the relationship between dependent and independent variables.  

**2.** What is the evidence in your Experimental Demonstration?  
The evidence is the scientific data used to support the claim. Evidence must be:
- Sufficient—Use enough evidence to support the claim.
-  Appropriate—Use data that support your claim. Leave out information that doesn’t support the claim.
- Qualitative, Quantitative, or a combination of both.

**3.** What is the reasoning for your Experimental Demonstration?

 The reasoning ties together the claim and the evidence:  
- Shows how or why the data count as evidence to support the claim.
- Justifies why this evidence is important to this claim.
- Includes one or more scientific principles that are important to the claim and evidence.

**4.** List the independent variable(s) in your Experimental Demonstration.

**5.** List the dependent variable(s) in your Experimental Demonstration. Also briefly explain why these are dependent variable(s).

**6.** List the controlled variable(s) in your Experimental Demonstration. Also briefly explain why these are controlled variable(s).

**7.** List the references (books and journal articles) used in preparing your report.  

- The list of references must follow an accepted referencing style (such as the APA style).
