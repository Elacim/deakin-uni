### The Task - 35% of your grade
The Experimental Demonstration Task is intended to be done remotely using electronic communication technology. This assessment task consists of three parts:
1. You will design, conduct, and record (video) a physics experiment. The recording must be between 3 and 4 minutes in duration and demonstrate the application of physics principle(s) to life science. This is a group task and all members must be present in the video (at least briefly).
2. A short report answering some questions. This is a group task.
3. Peer assessment of how your team worked as a team. This is an individual task.

The task will be done in groups of 2-3.

#### Submission dates
The group video and report must be submitted following the instructions below on Friday **10 May 2024**. (week 10 of trimester).  

The individual peer assessments must be completed by 17 May (week 11 of the trimester).
