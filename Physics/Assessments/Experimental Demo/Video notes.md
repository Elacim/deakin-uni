**Explanation**
Heart pumping video diagram - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHo-oVOqu1I

What we are creating is a rudimentary pump that should loosely mimic the heart. A pump is a structure that uses energy to push a fluid from one area to another through pressure in a partial vacuum. (fact check this) 
  
The heart works somewhat like a reciprocating pump with a flexible outer wall. It has an intake (atrium late diastole), compression (ventricle systole), then release (atrium + ventricle early diastole) phase. The blood intakes into the chamber, the chamber walls compress the fluid, which, as liquids are (usually) incompressible, pushes the fluid out, then the walls release. An important note is that on intake, the exit valve is closed and the intake valve open. On the compression, the valves flip states so that the intake valve is closed and exit valve open. This allows pressure to build up. 

Here is a quick demonstration of the experiment. Our fingers act as the heart valves. 

Our experiment is not identical to a human heart but it is fairly similar to a one-chambered heart where the atrium and ventricle are one and the same.
1. Resting state with exit artery valve closed and intake vein valve open. Pressure inside is equivalent to atmospheric pressure.
2. The chamber fills up with fluid, air in this case.
3. Intake vein valve closes and the exit valve opens.
4. External pressure is put onto the balloon (heart muscles contract).
	1. Internal pressure increases
5. From the increased pressure, liquid leaves the system through the exit artery straw.
6. The exit artery valve closes to prevent backflow. In our experiment, we did not perform this part which allowed air to flow in through the artery as well as the intake vein valve.
7. To reset, the heart muscles relax and the intake vein valve opens to restore normal operating pressure.

The heart is made up of 4 chambers, 2 atria and 2 ventricles. One of each can be found on the left and right side of the heart. Our mock heart resembles a rudimentary single-chambered heart, with the jar receiving and pumping blood, which is the purpose of the atrium and ventricle respectively. 

In our experiment, our intake fluid is air rather than blood and the output fluid is water dyed red. The principle is the exact same though.


**Equipment**
- Add text for each bit of equipment
- For each bit of text, make them progressively appear
	- Use a rotating mask? 

Clay/bluetack (for incremental blocking of the straws)
Food colouring (to make the water look like blood)
Jar (heart chamber)
Cup (blood dropoff)
Notepad + pen (taking data)
Straws (blood vessels)
Stopwatch (10s timer)
Balloon (elastic walls of the heart)
Scissors (to cut straw insertion points into the balloon)
A scale (measuring water output)
Water (the ‘blood’)


Here we use safety scissors while following our safety precautions of keeping the fingers as far as possible from the blades. This cut is needed so we can have a flat elastic drum surface to press down and create pressure in the jar.
We do have to have our fingers close to the blade for this step, but it is a low risk operation as there is little pressure needed to make the cuts into the balloon.
 
Next we insert our blood vessels, straws, into the cuts we made. The blue is the entry vein and red the exit artery. The drum surface must grip onto the straws tightly with no air gaps so the pressure can be maintained when compressed. The artery straw empties into this container. 


| Control | Half-block | Full-block |
| ------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 56      | 57         | 0          |
| 49      | 36         | 1          |

**Control experiments**
We start with the control. For the controls and treatments, we pump the blood for 10 seconds then we weigh the blood in grams, then finally we subtract the grams of blood the from the container weight.

Grams/10s

**Changing straws**
Here we're  changing out the straws for the experimentals. For the first experimental, we used a straw with half it's radius filled with bluetack. We predicted that the flow rate would be reduced by half.


###### Experimental (half-blocked)
The half-blocked experimental had the most interesting results, with the first attempt showed unexpectedly high flow (57) and the second attempt a low flow (36).

We suspect the first attempt may be due to us putting more pressure onto the balloon to achieve high flow rates instead of a uniform pressure for all the controls and experimentals. 

The second attempt appeared to be due to our heart chamber being only half full, meaning more external pressure would be necessary for the water to overcome the internal pressure and exit the artery straw.
(??)


###### **Experimental (full-blocked)**
The first full-blocked experimental let out a surprising 1 gram of blood due to a minor leak and the second no grams of blood as expected.
