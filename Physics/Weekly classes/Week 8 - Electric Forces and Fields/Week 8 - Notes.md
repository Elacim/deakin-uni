An electric field isn't electrons, it's the attractive/repulsive force between positively-charged and negatively-charged areas.

The lighter the mass, the more wavelike it is. This is the case for electrons. 
They maintain separation from the nucleus as they need space to travel as waves.

**Insulators**
Charges do not move

**Conductors**
Charges are free to move.
These charges adjust until electrostatic equilibrium is reached, where there is no net force on a given charge.
