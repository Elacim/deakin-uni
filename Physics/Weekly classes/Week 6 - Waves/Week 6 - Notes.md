**Measurable physical phenomena**
- Waves
- Matter


**Physical waves**
-> A vibrational, trembling motion in an elastic, deformable body
- Vibrations like earthquakes, tuning fork, vocal cords

All waves carry energy, the energy being proportional to the square of it's amplitude,  like vibrations. We are all bundles of energy.
