**Power**
Objects can have the same mass and reach the same speeds, meaning they have the same [[Kinetic energy]]. But, they may reach that at different times which means different powers:
	$\ce{power = \frac{work}{time} = \frac{energy}{time}}$
	Unit = joules/second = watts
An 3000kg elevator moves 210m up in 23 seconds at a constant speed. What is the power?
Using [[Gravitational potential energy]] equation:
$P = \frac{U_{g}}{\ce{time}} = \frac{3000 \times 9.8 \times 210}{23} = 268kW$

A runner eats a 2000kJ energy bar and runs at 10km/hr (=1200W/hr). How far will they run using only this energy bar energy?
$power = \frac{energy}{time} \rightarrow time = \frac{energy}{power}$
$\frac{2000 \times 10^{3}}{1200} = 1667$s $\div (60 \times 60) = 0.46$ hours
-> Distance = $v \times t$
	-> $10km/hr$ $\times 0.46hr = 4.6km$
