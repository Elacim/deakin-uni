#### Position and time
- Measure movement in a straight line using x-axis number line
- Measured using 4 coordinates (x, y, z, and time)
- Motion is only quantified using changes in time

![[Kinematics]] 


Initial velocity is 20m/s. At 4s, the deceleration is 2.5m/s.

Find the area:
	Rectangle: $4 \times 20 = 80$m
	Triangle:$\frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 20 = 80$m
	Area: $80 + 80 = 160$m



**Forces**
Force? :: Push or a pull acting on an object, requiring an agent. It is a vector. Can be contact or long-range.

**Newton's first law**
- An object continues at rest or at a constant velocity (constant speed in a straight line) unless an external force acts on it. 
Inertia :: A measure of an object's resistance to changes in it's motion
	Tendency to remain in it's state

[[Newton's Second Law]] 

Weight = depends on gravity
Mass = doesn't depend on gravity
Not gravity, instead it is acceleration due to gravitational force
Forces are vectors: Magnitude (force strength) and the direction 

0) Calculate the resultant (net) force, and acceleration in the following situations: 
a) Two children pull in opposite directions with equal force on a toy weighing 1 kg 
	No force, no acceleration
b) A dog pulls a bone to the right with a force of 100 N, while another dog pulls on the same bone to the left with a force of 90 N. The bone weighs 0.5 kg. 
	100N right - 90N left = 10N right
	10N/0.5kg = 20m/s
c) A set of car wheels exerts a force 1000 N north on a car, while the friction is 500 N south. The car weighs 1000 kg. 
	500/1000 = 0.5m/s
d) The same car in part c travels at constant velocity north, with the same frictional force to the south. What is the force of the car wheels?
	1000N north - 1000N south = 0N, no direction
	Acceleration is 0$\ce{m/s^{2}}$
