Density symbol :: Rho, or $\rho$ 
Density formula :: $\rho = \frac{Mass}{Volume}$ $\ce{kg m^{3}}$
Density of water :: $\rho_{water} = \ce{1.0g/cm^{3}}$

#### Questions
A $1.0 \times 10^{-3}$ chunk of material has a mass of $3kg$.
- What is it's density?
	- $\frac{3}{0.001} = 3000kg$/$m^{3}$
- Would a $2.0 \times 10^{-3}$ material have the same mass? 
	- No. It would have $\frac{M}{V}=\rho \rightarrow M = \rho \times V$,
		- $3000 \times 0.002 = 6$kg
- Would it have the same density? 
	- Yes. Density of the same material should remain the same regardless of volume.


A gold ($\rho = 19,300kg/m^{3}$) bar is $177.8mm$ long, $92.2mm$ wide, and $44.45mm$ tall. What is the mass?
$=\frac{177.8}{1000} * \frac{92.2}{1000} * \frac{44.45}{1000} = 0.0007286760 = 7.3 \times 10^{-4}$
$19,300 * 7.3\times10^{-4} = 14.089$kg


Blood has a density of $1060$kg $m^{-3}$ whereas cerebrospinal fluid is $1007$kg $m^{-3}$. What mass of cerebrospinal fluid will have the same volume as 50.0g of blood?
$V_{f} = V_{b}$
$\frac{m_{f}}{d_{f}} = \frac{m_b}{d_{b}}$
-> $m_{f} = \frac{m_{b}}{d_{b}}\times d_{f}$
-> $\frac{0.05kg}{1060} \times 1007 = 0.0475 = 47.5g$
