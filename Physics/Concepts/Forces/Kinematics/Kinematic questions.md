###### A car starts from rest and accelerates uniformly over a time of 5.21 seconds for a distance of 110 m. Determine the acceleration of the car.
Known: 
- $V_{i}=0$$\ce{m/s^{2}}$ 
- $t = 5.21$
- $x = 110$
Need: 
- $a=?$

$\Delta x = v_{i}t + \frac{1}{2}at^{2}$
-> $\Delta x - v_{i}t = \frac{1}{2}at^{2}$
-> $2(\Delta x - v_{i}t) = at^{2}$
-> $\frac{2(\Delta x - v_{i}t)}{t^{2}} = a$

$a = \frac{2(110 - 0\times5.21)}{5.21^{2}}$
-> $\frac{220}{27.1441}$
$a = 8.105$ $\ce{m/s^{2}}$



#### Velocity
###### A man falls from a waterfall for 2.6s. What is his final velocity and displacement?
Knowns: 
- $a = 9.81$ $\ce{m/s^{2}}$
- $t = 2.6$s
- $v_{i} = 0$$\ce{m/s^{2}}$
Unknowns:
- $v_{f} = ?$
- $x = ?$

$v_{f} = v_{i} + at$
-> $v_{f} = 0 + 9.81 \times 2.6$
$v_{f} = 25.506$ $\ce{m/s^{2}}$


$\Delta x = v_{f}t - \frac{1}{2}at^{2}$
-> $25.506 \times 2.6 - \frac{1}{2} \times 9.81 \times 2.6^{2}$
-> $66.3156 - 33.1578$
$x = 33.1578$m fallen

$\Delta x = v_{i}t + \frac{1}{2}at^{2}$
-> $18.5*2.47 + 0.5 * 11.174 * 2.47^2$
$x = 79.78$m travelled.

- $x = 1.4$m
- $a = 1.67$$\ce{m/s^{2}}$
- $v_{i} = 0$$\ce{m/s^{2}}$

$t=\sqrt{\frac{2\Delta x}{a}}$
-> $\sqrt{ \frac{2\times1.4}{1.67} }$
-> $\sqrt{1.677}$
$t = 1.295$s
or
$\Delta x = v_{i}t + \frac{1}{2}at^{2}$
-> $1.40 = 0\times t + \frac{1}{2}1.67 \times t^{2}$
-> $1.40 = 0.835 \times t^{2}$
-> $\frac{1.40}{0.835} =  t^{2}$
-> $t = \sqrt{1.676}$
$t = 1.295$s

- $x = ?$

$a = \frac{v_{f}-v_{i}}{t}$
-> $\frac{444-0}{1.83}$
$a = 242.6229$$\ce{m/s^{2}}$

$\Delta x = v_{i}t + \frac{1}{2}at^{2}$
-> $x = 0 + \frac{1}{2}242.6229 \times 1.83^{2}$
$x = 406.26$m travelled

Or by rearranging $v^{2}_{f} = v^{2}_{i} + 2ax$
$x = \frac{v^{2}_{f} - v^{2}_{i}}{2a}$
-> $\frac{444^{2} - 0^{2}}{2(242.6229)}$
$x = 406.26$ m travelled
