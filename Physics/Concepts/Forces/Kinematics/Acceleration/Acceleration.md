Change in velocity divided by the change in time
- [[Vector]] 
- $a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v_{f} - v_{i}}{t_{f} - t_{i}}$ 
- $\Delta v = a \times \Delta t$
- $\Delta t = \frac{\Delta v}{a}$

When acceleration and velocity are in the same direction = speeding up
Acceleration and velocity in the opposite = slowing down

Sprinter starts from rest, accelerates at 5m/s
How fast after:
	2 seconds?: $v = 5 \times 2 = 10$m/s
	5 seconds?: $v = 5 \times 5 = 25$m/s

Accelerate at 2m/s from initial velocity of 5m/s
$v = u + at$
$u$ = initial velocity
$v = 5 + 2(4) \rightarrow 13$m/s

Cheetah starts from rest and reaches a speed of 20m/s in 5 seconds.
The acceleration is therefore $a = \frac{20}{5} = 4$m/s$^{2}$

Human from rest reaches a speed of 10m/s in 5 seconds
$\frac{10}{5} = 2$m/s$^{2}$

Car changes speed from 60 to 100km/h in 10 seconds
$a = \frac{40}{10} = 4 \rightarrow \times \frac{5}{18} = 1.11$m/s
km/h $\times \frac{5}{18} = m/s^{2}$

Car travels at a constant speed of 20m/s and changes direction from north to south in 5 seconds
$\frac{20}{5} = 4$m/s
