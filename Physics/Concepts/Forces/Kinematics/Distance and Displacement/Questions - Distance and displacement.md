**Example: A person moves 3 steps left then 5 steps right.** 
Distance?: 8 steps
Displacement?: 2 steps

**Move left 3 steps, move right 3 steps:**
Distance: 6 steps
Displacement: 0 steps

**Bird flies 3km east then 3km north**
Distance: 6km
Displacement: $\sqrt{3^{2} + 3^{2}} = 4.24$

**3m left, 4m right**
Distance: 7m
Displacement: 1m right

**4km north, 3km south**
Distance: 7km
Displacement: 1km north

**Person steps 3m left and 4m forward**
Distance: 7m
Displacement: $\sqrt{9 + 16} = 5$m

**4km north, 3km east**
Distance: 7km
Displacement: $\sqrt{9 + 16} = 5$km north-east

**Pilot takes off, travels around the earth, and lands at the same spot**
Distance: Earth's radius
Displacement: 0km
