$\text{disp} = \sqrt{(\text{side}_{1})^{2}+ (\text{side}_{2})^{2}}$

##### Distance
- Length of a path between two points
- Is a [[Scalar]]

##### Displacement
- Length and direction of a path between two points
- Is a [[Vector]] 


This graph gives the displacement in a given interval of time

If velocity is positive (above horizontal axis), the area is positive
If velocity is negative (below), the area is negative
