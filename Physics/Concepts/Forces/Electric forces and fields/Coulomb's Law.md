? :: The force between two charges ($q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$) at a distance of $r$
Formula :: $F = K \frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r^{2}}$

Coulomb's constant :: $K = 9 \times 10^{9} \frac{N \times m^{2}}{C^{2}}$

Much like [[Gravity|gravity]], it works long-range. Unlike gravity though, it can be positive or negative.

**Which of these right hand charges ($q, 2q,$ or $4q$) experience the largest force?**
![[Coulomb's Law - force comparisons.png]]
1. $F = \frac{Qq}{(r)^{2}} = \frac{Qq}{r^{2}}$
2. $F = \frac{Q \times 2q}{(2r)^{2}} = \frac{Q2q}{4r^{2}} = \frac{Qq}{2r^{2}}$
3. $\frac{Q \times 4q}{(2r)^{2}} = \frac{Q\times4q}{4r^{2}} = \frac{Qq}{r^{2}}$





**Charge of an electron**
SI unit of charge :: Coulomb, $C$
Coulomb :: Amount of charge carried by a current of one ampere in one second
$e$ is the elementary unit of charge, $1.6 \times 10^{-19}C$
$N \times e = 1C \rightarrow 6.25 \times 10^{18}$ $e^{-}$ in 1 coulomb
