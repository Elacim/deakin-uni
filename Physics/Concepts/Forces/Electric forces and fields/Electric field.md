? :: The space around a charge; a region of influence. The electric force per unit charge on a point charge at that point.
What is $\overrightarrow{E}$? :: A vector at every point in space that describes the force applied to a positive charge (if the charge exists) 

Where does $E$ point? :: In the direction of decreasing potential + voltage as the force on positive charges is in the direction of $E$.

A positive charge will go with the electric field and a negative against.

$E = \ce{\frac{force}{charge} = \frac{F}{q}}$

$a = \frac{F}{m}$ and where $a = \frac{qE}{m}$

$F$ is the electric force. You can use $F=ma$ or $F = K \frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r^{2}}$
$q$ is the field charge
$E$ is the electric field (strength)


mass = $9 \times 10^{-6}$
Charge = $-3 \times 10^{-6}$
Acceleration = $250$ $\ce{m/s^{2}}$
Direction = North
$F = 250 \times (9\times10^{-6})$
-> $= 0.00225$N
$E = \ce{\frac{force}{charge}}$
-> $\frac{0.00225}{(-3)\times10^{-6}}$
$= -750$ due south



### Helpful diagrams
The electric field (shown by arrows) of positive charges move outwards.
The electric field of negative charges (arrows) move inwards.

Like-charges repel. The field lines go away from each other and never terminate.
![[Electric field - Positive to positive (same with negative).png]]

The number of field lines leaving the + charge equals the number terminating at the negative charge.
