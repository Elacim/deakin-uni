? :: Inducing the charges in an object from a distance causing the conductor electrons to shift
Charge induction :: Redistribution of electrical charge in an object caused by the influence of nearby charges

The electrons from the charging rod are not provided to A.
They bring the positive charges closer to it and repel the negative charges to B.
