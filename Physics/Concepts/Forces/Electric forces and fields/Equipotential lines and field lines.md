Electric field vectors are tangential (meaning they follow) to electric field lines
Equipotential lines are always perpendicular to field lines.

Electric field vectors are
tangential to electric field lines
because they show the direction
- as well as magnitude - of the
field
BUT
Because any change in
position that has a
component in the direction
of the field will result in a
change in potential; then
equipotential lines
are always perpendicular to
field lines.
