#### What do the lines represent?
They are isolines, or lines of equal potential. These are known as equipotential lines.

The lines are always perpendicular to the direction (vector arrows) / the field lines of the field.

Electric field vectors are tangential (meaning they follow) field lines because they show the field's direction and magnitude.

#### 2D and 3D representation

**2D diagram:** Here we can see a test charge (the $+$ sphere) affect the electric field. Noticeably, the distance between each line increases as the potential decreases, showcasing [[Coulomb's Law]].

**3D diagram:** Note the edges fit onto the circles and interpret this as a hill for a ball. You can see that an incoming $+$ charge would have to input exponentially more work to reach a higher potential (roll up the hill).

**Joint diagrams**
Here you can see that the 'ball' would ready roll from positive to negative. 
#### Comparing lines
![[Electric potential - Comparing field lines.png|200]]

A and C are on the same line, so there is little to no potential difference, same as B to D.
E to D/B has a $60$ Volt difference.

Positive charges move outwards and negative charges move inwards, shown by the vector arrows.
