**Terms**
Electric force :: The long-range force between charged objects

Neutral object :: An object with an equal number of positive and negative charges

**Conservation of charge**
- Something being charged is a transfer of electrons (not creation/destruction)
- An object's charge is always an integer multiple (no half electrons)

**Rules**
++ and -- repels while +- and -+ attracts

An absence of electrons is a positive charge

#### Polarisation
Charge polarisation :: The separation of the + and - charges in a neutral object
