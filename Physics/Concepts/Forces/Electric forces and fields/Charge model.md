An absence of electrons is a positive charge

++ and -- repels while +- and -+ attracts

Electric force :: The long-range force between charged objects
Neutral object :: An object with an equal number of positive and negative charges

**Conservation of charge**
- Something being charged is a transfer of electrons (not creation/destruction)
- An object's charge is always an integer multiple (no half electrons)

**Charge by rubbing**
Two compounds being rubbed may cause one to shed it's electrons to the other compound more readily than the other.
Valence are given up more easily.
This is how lightning is formed, by water droplets rubbing against one another.

Plastic rods rubbed with wool repel
A plastic rod w/ wool and a glass rod w/ silk attracts

#### Polarisation
Charge polarisation :: The separation of the + and - charges in a neutral object
