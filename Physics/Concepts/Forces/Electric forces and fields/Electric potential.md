Measurement :: $J/C$ or $V$olts

Electric potential measurement :: $V = \frac{U_{elec}}{Q}$
$V$ = voltage; electric potential in Volts. $\Delta V$ = potential difference
$U_{elec}$ = electric potential energy (joules)
$Q/q$ = Charge (coulombs) 


Electric field strength :: $V = E \times d$, $E = \frac{F}{q} = - \frac{\Delta V}{d}$
$V$ = electric potential in volts
$E$ = electric field strength in Volts/metre or Newtons/coulombs
$d$ = distance/length in metres


$\Delta V = \frac{\Delta EPE}{q} = \frac{ -\ce{work done} }{q} = \frac{E}{q}$ in volts, joules/coulombs
Work in the field done by the charge
$\Delta V$ is the change in electrical potential energy per unit of charge


![[Electric potential - Moving charges against a field.png]]
Work done to move the +1C particle is 10J
Positive charge moving against a field (+ to +) requires -work




Electric potential exists whether there is a charged particle to experience it or not

Moving against the natural movement of an electric field is going from a low to high potential energy. See [[Electric potential - Diagram.png]]

Charges naturally move from higher potential energies to lower potential energies
![[Electric potential - Movement of charges.png|200]]

Moving two 'like' charges (++ or --) closer together increases the electric potential energy of each charge.
Moving two 'unlike' charges (-+ or +-) further apart also increases the electric potential energy.

#### Questions
If a $3$C charge passes through a potential energy difference of $12$J, what is the voltage?
-> $V = \frac{12J}{3c} = 4$ volts

If a $32$C charge passes through a $600$V electric potential difference, what is the electrical energy given to the charge?
-> $U_{elec} = QV$, $32\times600 = 19,200$ Joules


##### Potential difference between A and B
What is potential difference between points A and B?
![[Electric potential - V=ed question 1.png]]
$V = E \times d$
$V = 5 \times 0.05\ce{m}$
$= 0.25$ volts

##### Find the velocity of a charged particle
![[Electric potential - Problem 1.png]]
If $E = 5$V/m and A and B (both protons) are 5cm apart, what is the velocity?
Proton charge is $1.6 \times 10^{-19}$C and the mass is $1.67 \times 10^{-27}$
We need to find the velocity, meaning we need the energy.

$U_{elec} = V\times q$ and $V = E \times d$
-> $U_{elec} = E \times d \times q$
-> $5\ce{V/m} \times 0.05\ce{cm} \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19}\ce{C}$
$U_{elec} = 4 \times 10^{-20}$ joules


[[Kinetic energy]] 
$K_{e} = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$
$v = \sqrt{ \frac{2U_{elec}}{m} }$
-> $v = \sqrt{ \frac{ 2\times 4 \times 10^{-20} }{1.67 \times 10^{-27}} }$
$v = 6921.2854$ $\ce{m/s^{2}}$

$\frac{1}{2} 1.67\times10^{-27} \times v^{2}$

##### Keep a charge stationary
![[Electric potential - Force to keep still.png]]
As $E=\frac{F}{q}$ therefore $F = E \times q$
$F = 5 \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19}$
$= 8 \times 10^{-19}$ Newtons


##### Perpendicular movement
How much work is being done?
![[Electric potential - perpendicular charge movement.png]]
There is no work as it is moving along the equipotential line


##### Distance of object moving
A $20,000$ N/C^-1 uniform electric field does $+5000$J of work on a $+0.20$C charged object.
1. Does the charged object move with or against the field?
With the field, found as work is positive

2. How far did it move?
$W_{elec} = F\times d$ which $W_{elec} = (q \times E) \times d$
-> $d = \frac{W_{elec}}{qE}$
-> $\frac{5000}{ 0.20 \times 20,000 }$
$= \frac{5000J}{4000N}$
$= 1.25$m 

3. Change in electric potential through which the object was moved?
$U_{elec} = -q \times \Delta V$ so $\Delta V = - \frac{U_{elec}}{q}$
$= \frac{-5000J}{0.20C} = -25,000$V


##### Which positions result in changes of potential?
![[Electric potential - ABC comparison.png]]
A to B? Yes
A to C? Yes. It also have the same energy as A to B as the lines moved is the same.
B to C? No. It is moving perpendicular.


##### Comparing lines
![[Electric potential - Comparing field lines.png]]

A and C are on the same line, so there is no potential difference, same as B to D.
E to D and B has a $60$ Volt difference.
