Measurement :: $J/C$ (joules per coulomb) or $V$olts

Electric potential (difference) measurement :: $V = \frac{U_{elec}}{Q}$ or $V = \frac{W}{Q}$
$V$ = voltage; electric potential in Volts. $\Delta V$ = potential difference (change per unit of charge)
$U_{elec}$ = electric potential energy (joules)
$Q/q$ = Charge (coulombs) 
$W$ = work done


Electric field strength :: $V = E \times d$ given $E = \frac{F}{q} = - \frac{\Delta V}{d}$
$V$ = electric potential in volts
$E$ = electric field strength in Volts/metre or Newtons/coulombs
$d$ = distance/length in metres


$\Delta V = \frac{\Delta EPE}{q} = \frac{ -\ce{work done} }{q} = -\frac{E}{q}$ in volts, joules/coulombs

Work done to move the +1C particle is 10J
Positive charge moving against a field (+ to +) requires -work




Electric potential exists whether there is a charged particle to experience it or not

Moving against the natural movement of an electric field is going from a low to high potential energy. See [[Electric potential - Diagram.png]]

Charges naturally move from higher potential energies to lower potential energies
![[Electric potential - Movement of charges.png|200]]

Moving two 'like' charges (++ or --) closer together increases the electric potential energy of each charge.
Moving two 'unlike' charges (-+ or +-) further apart also increases the electric potential energy.
