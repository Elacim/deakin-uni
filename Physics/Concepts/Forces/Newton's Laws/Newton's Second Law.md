Acceleration is directly proportional to the net force.
$\sum\limits \overrightarrow{F} = m\overrightarrow{a}$ - the little arrow means vector

[[Coulomb's Law]] is used to calculate the forces on electric charges

The sum of forces is equal to the mass and acceleration of an object
SI: $\ce{1N = 1kg \times m/s^{2}}$
U.S.A. $\ce{lb = slug \times ft/s^{2}}$

a) The acceleration of an object where a net force of 10 N is applied to a mass of 2 kg 
	$a = \frac{F}{m} \rightarrow \frac{10N}{2kg} = 5$m/s$^{2}$
b) The net force on an object of mass 5 kg accelerating at 3 m.sec$^{2}$
	$F=ma \rightarrow 5kg \times 3\text{m/s} = 15N$
c) The mass of an object accelerating at 4 m.sec$^{2}$ when a net force of 16 N is applied to it
	$m=\frac{F}{a} \rightarrow \frac{16N}{4\text{ m/s}}=4$kg

Identify if there is a non-zero net force on the following systems:
a) A car travelling at constant velocity
	No
b) A car braking to a stop
	Yes
c) A person in a car without seatbelts during a sudden crash 
	No (you are moving with the car)
d) A person in a car with seatbelts during a sudden crash 
	Yes (you are decelerating)
e) A passenger on an airplane, without seatbelts, in sudden turbulence where the plane drops quickly
	No
f) A passenger on an airplane, with seatbelts, in sudden turbulence where the plane drops quickly
	Yes
g) A girls lifts a bag upward with constant velocity
	No
h) A parachutist jumps from a plane and accelerates in the initial stage of the fall 
	Yes
i) The same parachutist opens the chute and falls at constant velocity
	No
