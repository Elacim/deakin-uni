For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
Every force occurs as one of a pair of action/reaction forces.
This implies that there are always two bodies involved in the application of forces, each applying a force to one another.

A ball rolling down a hill on earth is one action, with the opposite reaction being the earth being pulled towards the ball
