All objects falling in a vacuum accelerate downwards at (roughly) the same constant rate regardless of weight

Air resistance in a vacuum :: Non-existent



$a=\ce{\frac{Net force}{m}} = \frac{mg-R}{m}$
Weight = $mg$
Air resistance = $R$
Mass of the person + parachute = $m$

When $R=mg$, $a=0$, meaning terminal speed is reached 

Mass and air resistance


**Terminal velocity**
A point is reached when a body falling through air can not go any faster.
Dependent on:
- Shape
- Surface
- Weight
