**Tension force**
When a string pulls on a n object, it exerts a tension force.
The direction is always in the direction of the string.
The conventional symbol is $\overrightarrow{T}$

**Normal force**
Force acting perpendicular to the contact surface
How to find? By the weight (more precisely, the mass) of the object on an object/surface



**Spring force**
Also known as elastic force
Can either push/pull
Symbol is $F$ or $F_{sp}$

Compressed springs exert pushing forces on an object while a stretched spring exerts a pulling force on an object

**[[Friction]]**
Calculated from the normal force as it is always parallel to the surface.
Exerted by a surface.
Kinetic friction ($f_{k}$) is what acts on a sliding object
Static friction ($f_{s}$) is what keeps an object stuck on a surface

**Drag force** - $D$
Is a resistive force, like air resistance/drag.
Drag opposes motion through fluids/gases


In physics there are two states of matter - solids and liquids as gases act very similar to liquids
