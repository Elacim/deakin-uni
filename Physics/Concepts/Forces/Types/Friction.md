Caused by :: Irregularities in surfaces
What is friction :: The force opposing motion between systems (objects) in motion
Direction :: Always opposite to direction of motion
Types of friction :: Static and kinetic
Minimum and maximum coefficient of friction :: $0.0-1.0$

Friction from static friction is stronger 

An object sliding down an incline experiences friction up the incline

**Symbols**
$f$ is friction
$\mu$ is the coefficient of friction
$N$ is the magnitude of the force perpendicular to the surface (normal force)

$\mu_{k}$ will always be a bit less than $\mu_{s}$ as there is less friction during kinetic friction
#### Static friction
Symbol :: $f_{s}$

Given no motion, $f_{s} \geq \mu_{s} N$
When $f_{s} = \mu_{s} N$, there is an exact balance.
When $\mu_{s}N > f_{s}$, the object can move

###### Example
$1000N$, $\mu_{s} = 0.8$
$f_{s} = 0.8*1000N = 800N$ 
You need to exceed $800N$ to move the object.

#### Kinetic friction
Symbol :: $f_{k}$
 Size given by :: $f_{k} = \mu_{k}N$

### Examples

![[Friction - Example coefficients.png]]

A 50kg table with a $\mu_{s}$ of $0.1$ has 100N of force applied to it. Will the table move?
-> Table newtons: $50kg \times 9.8 = 490N$
-> $f = 0.1 \times 490 = 49N$
Since $100N > 49N$, the table will move

A 200kg log with a $\mu_{s}$ of $0.8$ has 1000N of force applied to it. Will the log move?
-> Log newtons: $200 \times 9.8 = 1960N$
-> $f = 0.8 \times 1960 = 1568N$
Since $1000N < 1568N$, the log will *not* move

A football player is pushing a $60kg$ bag across the ground at a constant speed. Given $\mu_k=0.30$ between the bag and grass, how much force must she apply to the bag?
-> $60kg \times 9.8 = 588N$
-> $f_{k} = 588 \times 0.30 = 176.4N$
She must apply $176.4$N to move the bag.

Ice-on-ice has a $\mu_{k}=0.03$. A 3kg ice block pushed with a constant force of $15N$, what is it's acceleration?
-> $3kg \times 9.8 = 29.4N$
-> $f_{k} = 29.4N \times 0.03 = 0.882N$
-> $15N - 0.882N = 14.118N$
-> $F=ma$, $14.118N = 3kg \times a$
	-> $\frac{14.118N}{3kg} = a$
	-> $a = 4.706\text{m/s}^{2}$
