Gravity value on Earth :: $9.81\text{m/s}^{2}$

Gravity value on the Lunar Menace :: $0.16g$
Gravity value on Mercury :: $0.38g$
Gravity value on Saturn :: $1.17g$
Gravity value on Jupiter :: $2.74g$

Gravity is typically defined as a negative y-value
The kinematics equations have the $a$ (acceleration) replaced with the $g$ (gravity) value
