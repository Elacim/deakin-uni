Weight comparisons: $A > C > B$
- The **depth is the same** so the pressure at the bottom is the same
	- The pressure is the same, meaning the force is the same
- **Force**
	- $A$ has force less than the weight of the water 
	- $B$ has force greater than the weight of the water
	- $C$ has force equal to the weight of the water
