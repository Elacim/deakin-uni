Pressure formula :: $\ce{Pa}=\frac{F}{A}$ (Force in N / Area in m^2)
Pressure name :: Pascals ($\ce{Pa}$), which is the SI unit of pressure
Liquid pressure :: $p = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{\rho A hg}{A} = \rho gh$, $\ce{\frac{(\rho A = Mass)(hg = Force)}{Area}}$
Absolute pressure :: $p = p_{0} + \rho gd$
$p_{0}$ is equal to... :: 1 atmosphere, which is equal to $1.013 \times 10^{5}\ce{Pa}$

Fluid pushes on all parts of the fluid which forces itself out of a container with holes

1. At a given depth, pressure is uniform in a uniform liquid
	1. If not, the fluid is in motion
2. Pressure is the same no matter the direction of the measurement
3. In liquids, pressure increases with depth. In gases, the pressure is near-identical.

A fluid at rest always acts perpendicular to any contacted surface


$P_{2} = P_{1} + \rho gd$. Point 2 is a depth $d$ below point 1, given a static fluid with uniform density 
$P = P_{atm} + \rho gd$ :: Pressure at a depth $d$ below the surface of a liquid open to the atmosphere

Pressure depth is not volume dependent, it is purely height dependent

Per metre of depth due to water, there is 9800N of force exerted

A diver at a depth of 10m would be experiencing $1000 \times 9.8 \times 10 = 98,000N$ of force
$P = 101,325Pa + 1000\ce{kg} \times 9.81\ce{\frac{m}{s^{2}} \times 10\ce{m}}= 199325 = 2.0 \times 10^{5}Pa$

#### Importance of $p_{0}$


#### Pressure comparisons
**Elephant weighs 6 tons, feet around 0.15$\ce{m^{2}}$**
$\frac{6\times1000\times9.81}{4\times0.15} = 98100$ pascals

**Woman weighs 60kg, with a footprint of 0.0015$\ce{m^{2}}$**
$\frac{60\times9.81}{2\times0.0015} = 196200$ pascals
