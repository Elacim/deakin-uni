? :: The pressure by itself not including the atmospheric pressure
Formula :: $\ce{pascals} = \rho gd$ or $\rho g h$
$\rho g h$/$\rho gd$ meaning :: Density ($\ce{kg/m^{3}}$) $\times$ Gravity ($\ce{m/s^{2}}$) $\times$ Height/Difference ($\ce{metres}$)

$P_{gauge} = P_{abs} - P_{atm}$
Absolute pressure :: $P = P_{gauge} + P_{atm}$

#### Manometer
- Used to find the pressure difference in mmHg
- Measures [[Gauge pressure]] 
- $\Delta P = P_{B} - P_{C} = \rho gd$
- Find the pressure of a gas by comparing against atmospheric pressure

$\rho_{Hg}$  = $13,600$kg/$m^{3}$

A mamometer's mercury rises by 12cm when attached to a gas. What is the gauge pressure of the gas?
$d_{ifference} = -12 + -12 = -24cm$
-> $24cm \xrightarrow{\text{metres}} 0.24$ metres
$\rho g d$
-> $13,600 \times -0.24m \times 9.8 = -31987.2 = -32kPa$
How about the absolute pressure?
$P = P_{gauge} + P_{atm}$
-> $-32kPa + 101kPa = 69kPa$



#### Example
$\rho gd = 1000 \times 9.8 \times 30 = 2.9 \times 10^{5}$N/$\ce{m^{2}}$
