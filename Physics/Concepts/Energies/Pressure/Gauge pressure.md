? :: The pressure by itself not including the atmospheric pressure
$\rho gd$ or $\rho g h$ :: Gauge pressure

$P_{gauge} = P_{abs} - P_{atm}$
Absolute pressure :: $P = P_{gauge} + P_{atm}$


#### Manometer
- Used to find the pressure difference in mmHg
- Measures [[Gauge pressure]] 
- $\Delta P = P_{B} - P_{C} = \rho gd$
- Find the pressure of a gas by comparing against atmospheric pressure

$\rho_{Hg}$  = $13,600$kg/$m^{3}$

A mamometer's mercury rises by 12cm when attached to a gas. What is the gauge pressure of the gas?
$d = -12 + -12 = -24cm$
$13,600 \times -0.24m \times 9.8 = -31987.2 = -32kPa$
How about the absolute pressure?
$-32kPa + 101kPa = 69kPa$


#### Example
$\rho gd = 1000 \times 9.8 \times 30 = 2.9 \times 10^{5}$N/$\ce{m^{2}}$
