? :: The displacement of the medium (like air, water, string) is the sum of the wave displacements at any given instance
Another way of saying this is that they superpose on each other.

Requirements :: Two or more waves being present **simultaneously** at a single point in space

Why is it important? :: Matter cannot be in the exact same position as other matter but an infinite number of waves can, and they retain their characteristics.
- A radio antenna can receive radio signals regardless of other signals
