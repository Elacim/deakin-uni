Speed of light :: $3 \times 10^8$ $\ce{m/s^{2}}$ in a vacuum


Displacement of a wave moving to the right :: $y(x, t) = A \cos (2\pi ( \frac{x}{\lambda} - \frac{t}{T} ))$
-> Total wave motion is a function of both time and horizontal displacement

**You see a flash of lightning then 8s you hear the thunder. How far away did the lightning strike?**
$d = v \Delta t \rightarrow 343 \ce{m s^{2}} \times 8.0s = 2.7 km$
