$f = \frac{1}{T}$
$v = \frac{\lambda}{T}$
$v = f \lambda$

**There is a wave travelling at 25m/s and with a frequency of 20Hz**. What is the wavelength and period?
$\lambda = \frac{v}{f} \rightarrow \frac{25}{20} = 1.25$m
$T=\frac{\lambda}{v} = \frac{1.25}{25} = 0.05s$

**A boats bobs on a wave that oscillates from 3 to 4 metres. There is 2.9s between crests of the waves. The wave is moving at 2m/s.** What is the distance between crests of this wave?
$v=\frac{\lambda}{T} \rightarrow \lambda = vT$
$2 \times 2.9 = 5.8$m

**A wave travelling on a string has a period of $0.20$s, a wavelength of $32$cm, and an amplitude of $3$cm**. What is the speed of this wave?
$v=\frac{\lambda}{T}$
-> $v = \frac{0.32}{0.20}$
$1.60$ $\ce{m/s^{2}}$

**A wave has period 0.33s and wavelength 4.5m**. What is the wave speed?
$v=\frac{\lambda}{T}$
-> $\frac{4.5}{0.33}$
$13.64$ $\ce{m/s^{2}}$

**A wave travels at a speed of 200 $\ce{m/s^{2}}$ with a wavelength of 4.0m.** What is it's frequency?
$v = f\lambda \rightarrow \frac{v}{\lambda}$
-> $\frac{200}{4.0}$
$50$ Hz
