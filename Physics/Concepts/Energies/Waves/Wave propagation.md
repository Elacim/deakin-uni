- [[Waves]] 

- Can be in liquids/solids/gases.
- Electromagnetic exclusively can travel in a vacuum
	- Electric and magnetic fields (which are $90\degree$ to each other) vibrate, potentially inducing $e^{-}$ vibration
	- All travel at the speed of light in a vacuum
- On propagation, particles vibrate but do not move with the wave

Traversal depends on medium and wave type

Sounds travels faster in what type of air? :: Hot and humid
