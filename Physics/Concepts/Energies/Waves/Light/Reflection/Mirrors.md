Why do we look the same distance in a mirror as we are?
> Because the light ray travels forwards, hits the mirror, then travels back. The distance the ray goes is how far you appear.

##### Curved mirrors
Concave mirrors curve inwards (makeup mirrors, hubble telescope), convex outwards (security mirror, a car's rear-view mirror)

Concave mirrors make objects appear magnified whereas convex make them appear smaller
