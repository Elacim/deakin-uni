**What is the critical angle?**
When a ray collides with a medium, there are two resulting rays: 
1. a refracted ray and
2. a reflected ray

Total internal reflection occurs when the angle of incidence ($\theta_{1}$) exceeds a critical angle with respect to the surface normal.

Why? Because the ray would be refracted $90\degree$ from $n_{1}$ to $n_{2}$, meaning there is no refracted ray as it cannot escape into $n_{2}$.

**Finding the critical angle**
We can use Snell's law and adjust it to our needs.
A critical angle ($c\degree$) is formed by a $90\degree$ angle between $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$, so we substitute that in to $n_{1}$'s theta.

$n_{1}\sin(90\degree) = n_{2}\sin(c\degree)$
-> $n_{1} \times 1 = n_{2}\sin(c\degree)$
-> $\frac{n_{1}}{n_{2}} = \sin(c\degree)$
-> $\sin(c\degree) = \frac{n_{1}}{n_{2}}$
$c\degree = \arcsin(\frac{n_{1}}{n_{2}})$
