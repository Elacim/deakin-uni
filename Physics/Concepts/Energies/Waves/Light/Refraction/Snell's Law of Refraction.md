**Equation**
$n_{1} \times \sin(\theta_{1}) = n_{2} \times \sin(\theta_{2})$
$n_{1} \times \sin(\theta_{1}) = n_{2} \times \sin(90\degree - \theta_{1})$

$\theta_{2} = \arcsin(\frac{n_{1}\sin(\theta_{1})}{n_2})$

**Quick-identifications**
Rays going from low to high $\ce{IoR}$
- Smaller angle with the normal (bends to the normal)
- Objects are closer than they appear

Rays going from high to low $\ce{IoR}$
- Larger angle with the normal (bends away from the normal)

The medium with the large IoR has the smaller angle

**Example**
In this image, what is the index of refraction of the plastic?
![[Law of Refraction - Snell's law example.png|200]]
$n_{1} = 1.00$ (air at STP)
$\theta_{1} = 45\degree$, $90 - 45 = 45\degree$
$n_{2} = ?$
$\theta_{2} = 90\degree - 55\degree = 35\degree$
-> $1.0 \times \sin(45\degree) = n_{2} \times \sin(35\degree)$
-> $\sin(45\degree) = n_{2} \times \sin(35\degree)$
-> $\frac{\sin(45\degree)}{\sin(35\degree)} = n_{2}$
-> $n_{2} = 1.233$
