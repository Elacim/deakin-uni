In diverging lenses, the focal length is the distance from the lens to the near focal point. [[Class 10.pdf#page=37|More info here]]. It will therefore always be $-f$
(Near) Focal point :: The point at which parallel rays *appear* to diverge from

#### Effects

**Before, at, and after the near focal point**
- Parallel rays will appear to diverge from the near focal point 
- Virtual image on the object side
- Image is smaller and upright

#### Drawing a ray diagram
1. Draw a ray from the top of the object to the lens
	1. Using the near focal point as a reference, diverge the ray from this point
2. Draw a ray going towards the far focal point
	1. On reaching the lens, diverge the ray perpendicular to the lens
3. Trace the two rays backwards until you find an intersection
	1. This is where the top of the image is
