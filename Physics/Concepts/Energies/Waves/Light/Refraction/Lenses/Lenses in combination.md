When lenses are combined, the image formed by the first lens acts as the object for the second lens.

Systems of lenses can be found using multiple [[Thin Lens Equation]]s 
$\frac{1}{p_{1}} + \frac{1}{q_{1}} = \frac{1}{f_{1}}$
$\frac{1}{p_{2}} + \frac{1}{q_{2}} = \frac{1}{f_{2}}$
$p_{2} = s - q_{1}$ (see [[Lens equations#Terms]])
