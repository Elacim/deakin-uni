When lenses are combined, the image formed by the first lens acts as the object for the second lens.

Systems of lenses can be found using multiple [[Thin Lens Equation]]s 
$\frac{1}{f}_{1} = \frac{1}{d_{o}}_{1} + \frac{1}{d_{i}}_{1}$
$\frac{1}{f}_{2} = \frac{1}{d_{o}}_{2} + \frac{1}{d_{i}}_{2}$


$p_{2} = s - q_{1}$ (see [[Lens equations#Terms]])
