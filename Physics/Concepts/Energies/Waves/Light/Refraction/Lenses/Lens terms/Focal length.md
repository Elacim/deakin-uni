**Focal length**
Dependent on the curve of the lens, the focal length is the distance of the focal point from the lens ($f$)

A positive focal length means we calculate from *before* the lens.

Thick lenses have a small $f$, causing the power/magnification of the lens to be greater.

**High/long focal length**
- The image appears closer
- The angle of view (how large the viewable area is) is reduced

**Low/small/shorter focal length**
- Rays are bent more
- The lens is more powerful (more refractive, more magnifying)
- The image appears further away
- The angle of view is increased
