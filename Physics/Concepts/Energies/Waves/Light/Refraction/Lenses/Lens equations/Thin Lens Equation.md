#### Thin Lens Equation
$\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_{o}} + \frac{1}{d_{i}}$ or $\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q}$
$d_{i} = \frac{fd_{o}}{d_{o} - f}$
- $d_{o}$/$p$ is always positive
- $f$ is positive for converging lenses and negative for diverging lenses
- Convert to the same units for accurate solutions ($\ce{cm}$ is fine as long as all terms, including $f$ are in $\ce{cm}$)
- $q$ can be negative if the image is virtual (formed on the same side as the object)

##### Example - Nearsightnedness
[[Myopia (myopic)]]
*Without her contact lenses, Dana cannot clearly see an object more than 40cm away. What refractive power should her contact lenses have to give her normal vision?*
For an object at infinity, the corrective lens must form a virtual image 40cm from the eye 
$q$ = -0.4m  (negative because the image is virtual)
$p$ = $\infty$
$f$ = ?

$\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{\infty} + \frac{1}{-0.4}$
-> $\frac{1}{f} = 0 + \frac{1}{-0.4}$
-> $f = -0.4$

The refractive power is therefore $\frac{1}{-0.4} = -2.5D$


##### Example - Farsightedness
[[Hyperopia (hypermetropic)]]
*Winifred is unable to focus on objects closer than 2.50 m from her eye. What $P$ should her lenses have?*
Near point = 2.5 metres

$p = 0.25$m (the average adult near-point)
$q = -2.5$m

$\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{0.25} + \frac{1}{-2.5}$
-> $\frac{1}{f} = 4 + -0.4 = 3.6$ 
-> $f^{-1} = 3.6$
->$f = 3.6^{-1}$
$f = 0.28$m

$P = \frac{1}{f} = 3.6D$

\*alternative
$\frac{1}{f} = 3.6$
-> $1 = 3.6f$
$\times10: 10 = 36f$
-> $\frac{10}{36} = f$
$f = \frac{5}{18}$

##### Example - Daisy
A 1.2cm diameter daisy is 90cm away from the camera lens. Focal length of the lens is |150mm|.
1. What is the distance between the lens and the image sensor?
$d_{o} = 90$cm, $f = 15$cm, $h = 1.2$cm
-> $\frac{1}{15} = \frac{1}{90} + \frac{1}{d_{i}/q}$
-> $\frac{1}{15} - \frac{1}{90} =  + \frac{1}{d_{i}/q}$
-> $\frac{6}{90} - \frac{1}{90} =  + \frac{1}{d_{i}/q}$
-> $\frac{1}{d_{i}} = \frac{5}{90}$
-> $\frac{1}{d_{i}} = \frac{1}{18}$
-> $18 \times \frac{1}{d_{i}} = 1$
-> $\frac{18}{d_{i}} = 1$
-> $\frac{18}{d_{i}} \times d_{i} = 1 \times d_{i}$
$d_{i} = 18$cm

2. How large is the image of the daisy?
$m = - \frac{q}{p}$
-> $- \frac{18\ce{cm}}{90\ce{cm}}$
$m = -0.2$

$h' = mh$
-> $-0.2 \times 1.2\ce{cm}$
-> $h' = 0.24$cm
The height of the image is $0.24$cm in diameter.
