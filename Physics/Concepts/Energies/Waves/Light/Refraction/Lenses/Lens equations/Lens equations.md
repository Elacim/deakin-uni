##### Example questions
- [[Quiz 5#Q3) A 0.6 cm object is placed 4 cm from a converging lens (focal length = 3 cm). True or false The image formed will be upright.]]

# Terms
$f$ :: The [[Focal length]] 

$h$/$h_{o}$ :: The height of the object
$h'$/$h_{i}$ :: The height of the image, calculated with $h' = mh$

$s$/$d_{o}/p$ :: The distance from the object to the vertical centre of the lens

$s'$/$d_{i}/q$ :: The distance the objects appears to be from the lens. $d_{i}$ = image distance.
- Represented by equation $d_{i} = \frac{d_{o}f}{d_{o}-f}$
- Positive values mean the image is real and appears after the lens.
- Negative values mean the image is virtual and appears before the lens (i.e. on the same side as the object)

$m$ :: The transverse magnification of the image
- $m = \frac{-s'}{s}$ or $m = - \frac{q}{p}$ or $m = -\frac{d_{i}}{d_{o}}$
	- $m = \ce{ \frac{distance from lens to image}{distance from lens to object} }$
- $m = \frac{h'}{h}$ or $m = \frac{h_{i}}{h_{o}}$
	- $|m| = \ce{\frac{image size}{object size}}$
- The sign ($+$/$-$) indicates if it will appear upright/upside-down
- The value indicates the level of magnification.
- Positive values mean it will appear upright.
	-  e.g. $m=1$ will appear identical to the object.
- Negative values mean it will appear smaller and upside-down.
	- e.g. $m=-2.5$ will appear $2.5\times$ smaller.

#### Refractive power
$P$ :: Refractive power of a lens (alternative to focal length)
- $P = \frac{1}{f}$
- Note: Not the same as magnifying power in optical instruments
- Used when $2+$ thin lenses are close together
	- $P = P_{1} + P_{2} + ...$
- Measured in *diopters* ($\ce{D}$)
- Converging have positive values and diverging have negative

Diopters ($\ce{D}$) :: $1\ce{D} =$ refractive power of a lens with a focal length of $1$ metre, $1\ce{D} = 1m^{-1}$
