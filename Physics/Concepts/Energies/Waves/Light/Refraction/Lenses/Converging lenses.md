Refractions are based off of the idea that most lenses are thin. Thick lenses involve more complex calculations.

These have positive refractive powers ($P$, see [[Lens equations#Refractive power|refractive power]])

Converging lenses refract rays towards the optical axis.

#### Effects

###### Object before the object-side (near) focal point
- The image is real, appears upside-down, and is on the observer's side 
- Distance away from the lens in the direction of the near focal point makes the image appear increasingly closer to the observer-side focal point
- The closer the object to the lens, the farther and larger the image will appear.

###### At the focal point
At the focal point, the image will appear infinitely large and infinitely far away.

###### Object after the object-side focal point but before the lens
- The image is virtual, upright, and on the object-side
- Will appear larger
This is how reading glasses and magnifying glasses work.
