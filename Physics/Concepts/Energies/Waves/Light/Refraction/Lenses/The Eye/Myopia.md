Common name :: Near-sightedness

**Causes**
- Genetics
- Weak ciliary muscles

**Explanation**
A person's far point is normally $\infty$. A near-sighted person has a lower far-point.

An object is located beyond the eye's far point.

The image is formed in front of the retina.

**Fix**
A diverging lens (negative refractive power) is needed to slightly diverge the rays which when the rays then enter the eye lens, they refract into the retina.
