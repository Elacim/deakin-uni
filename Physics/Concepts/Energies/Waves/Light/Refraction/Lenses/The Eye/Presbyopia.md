As a person ages, the lens of the eye becomes less flexible and the eye’s ability to accommodate decreases, a phenomenon known as presbyopia.

Older people have difficulty focusing on objects held close to the eyes; from the age of about 40 years many people need eyeglasses for reading. At age 60, a near point of 50 cm is typical; in some people it may be 1 m or even more.

Reading glasses for a person suffering from presbyopia are similar to those used by a farsighted person
