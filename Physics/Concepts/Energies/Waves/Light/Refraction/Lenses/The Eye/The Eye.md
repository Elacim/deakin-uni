Where is the image formed on the eye? :: On the membranous retina at the back of the eye using it's 125 million photoreceptors (rods=black and white/cones)

Anatomy of the eye: [[The Eye - Anatomy.png]]

#### Eye focusing mechanism
**Accommodation** :: The shift in focal length of the flexible lens.

The focal length shifts which keeps the image distance constant even when the object distance shifts.

The shape of the lens changes by movement of *ciliary muscles*.

Focal length when viewing distant objects :: Longer $f$
Focal length when viewing close objects :: Shorter $f$

#### Eye near and far points
Near...far cm
Child :: $\approx 10..\infty$cm
Young adult :: $\leq 25..\infty$ cm

As you age, the near point increases. 
The far point can decrease from infinity.

#### Eye vs. digital cameras focusing mechanism

A camera differs by physically moving the lens to/from the image sensor as the object distance changes.
