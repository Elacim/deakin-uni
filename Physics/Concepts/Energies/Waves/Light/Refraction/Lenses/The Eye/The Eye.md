Where is the image formed on the eye? :: On the membranous retina at the back of the eye using it's 125 million photoreceptors (rods=black and white/cones)

Anatomy of the eye: [[The Eye - Anatomy.png]]


#### Diseases
- [[Myopia (myopic)]] 
	- Rays from before the far point converge too early caused by high $P$
	- *Diverging* lens needed to make them converge *later*
- [[Hyperopia (hypermetropic)]] and [[Presbyopia]] 
	- Rays from after the near point converge too late caused by low $P$
	- *Converging* lens needed to make them converge *sooner*


#### Near and far points of the eye
![[Near and far point#Points]] 


#### Eye focusing mechanism
**Accommodation** :: The shift in focal length of the flexible lens.

The focal length shifts which keeps the image distance constant even when the object distance shifts.

The shape of the lens changes by movement of *ciliary muscles*.

##### Distance objects
Focal length when viewing distant objects :: **Longer** $f$

The lens ........ when viewing a distant object :: **Shrinks**

The refractive power of the lens .............. when the focal length increases :: **Decreases**, think $P = \frac{1}{f}$

##### Near objects
Focal length when viewing close objects :: **Shorter** $f$

The lens ........ when viewing a distant object :: **Thickens**

The refractive power of the lens .............. when the focal length increases :: **Increases**, think $P = \frac{1}{f}$


#### Eye vs. digital cameras focusing mechanism
A camera differs by physically moving the lens to/from the image sensor as the object distance changes.
The eye changes the lens' focal point by altering the lens.
