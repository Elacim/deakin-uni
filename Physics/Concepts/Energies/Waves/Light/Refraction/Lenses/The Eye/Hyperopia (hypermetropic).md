Common name :: Far-sightedness
Etymology :: *over + sight* from the Greek *hyper + ≈çps*

**Cause**
Distant objects can be seen clearly but not nearby objects as the *near point is too large*

The refractive power of the eye is too small, causing the cornea/lens to not refract rays enough to converge them to the retina.
- Low refractive power meaning the rays converge too late

- Short eyeball

**Explanation**
An object is located between the near point and the eye lens.

The image is formed **behind** the retina, causing blurred vision.

**Fix**
A converging lens (positive refractive power) is needed to converge the rays to a closer point on the eye lens, refracting the rays onto the retina.
