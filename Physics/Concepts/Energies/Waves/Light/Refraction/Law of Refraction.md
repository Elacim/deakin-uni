Refraction occurs when light moves from one medium to another that have different densities. These densities alter the speed of light.

$n$ :: Index of Refraction ($\ce{IoR}$)

$n = \frac{\ce{speed of light in a vacuum}}{\ce{speed of light in a medium}} = \frac{c}{v}$

##### Why can we not see things like rocks in the water the further we get?
Light rays are going to be reflecting from the water and refracting from the rock into your eye.
At a closer distance, the rock light rays are more likely to hit your eye than the reflected rays.
At further distances, the probability of the rock rays hitting your eye decreases until only reflected rays hit your eye.  


#### Broken straws in glass?
The part of the straw in the air has rays originating from it. These rays go from straw -> air -> glass -> air -> your eye.

The rays go from straw -> water -> glass -> air -> your eye.

The way these refract makes the straw appear broken.
