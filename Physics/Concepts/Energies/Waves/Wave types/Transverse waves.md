##### Transverse waves in a string
$L$ = length of string in $\ce{m}$
$m$ = mass in $\ce{kg}$
$F$ = tension (force) in Newtons
$v$ = velocity in $\ce{m/s^{2}}$

$v = \sqrt{\frac{FL}{m}}$
$\mu = \frac{m}{L}$ :: Linear ($1$D) mass density
$v = \sqrt{\frac{F\times1}{\mu}} = \sqrt{\frac{F}{\mu}}$

Greater tension = faster wave
Greater length = faster wave
Greater mass = slower waves


#### Questions
A string of length $2.0$m has a mass of $125$mg. The string is attached to the ceiling and a pinata of mass $4.0$kg hangs from the other end. When whacked, a transverse pulse travels up the string. What speed is this pulse?

$v = \sqrt{\frac{FL}{m}}$

$125$mg to $\ce{kg}$: $\frac{125}{10^{8}} = 0.00000125 = $
