**Travelling waves** :: Infinitely travelling waves, like light

**Static/standing waves** :: Localised waves from 1 point to another, like a string or a column of air

Water surface waves can be considered as a transverse/longitudinal mixture.

Transverse matter waves (energy waves excluded) cannot propagate inside a liquid or gas.
-> Fluids cannot support a shear force

Seismic (earthquake) waves may be transverse or longitudinal
-> Transverse would be more destructive as it goes up and down

# Earthquake waves
P waves, or longitudinal waves, are faster than the more destructive but slower transverse S waves.
