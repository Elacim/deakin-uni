**Static/standing waves** :: Localised waves from 1 point to another, like a string or a column of air.

Why is it 'standing'? :: The wave itself doesn't travel, instead points in/on the medium oscillate, making the crests and troughs 'stand in place'



#### Nodes and antinodes
In a standing wave, there are points that never move.
These are known as nodes and are spaced $\frac{\lambda}{2}$ apart.
Antinodes are halfway between these nodes, at the point of maximum displacement.

### Creating a standing wave
$\lambda_{n} = \frac{2L}{n}$
Where $n = \text{number of nodes} - 2$

Requirement for creation :: It must satisfy $\lambda_{n}$, it cannot be any other values

#### In a thin pipe open at both ends
$\lambda_{n} = \frac{2L}{n}$
$f_{n} = \frac{v}{\lambda_{n}} = n \frac{v}{2L} = nf_{1}$
where $n=1,2,3...$

#### In a thin pipe closed at one end
$\lambda_{n} = \frac{4L}{n}$
$f_{n} = \frac{v}{\lambda_{n}} = n \frac{v}{4L} = nf_{1}$
where $n=1,3,5,7...$
