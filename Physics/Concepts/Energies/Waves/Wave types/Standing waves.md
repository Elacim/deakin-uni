**Static/standing waves** :: Localised waves from 1 point to another, like a string or a column of air.

Why is it 'standing'? :: The wave itself doesn't travel, instead points in/on the medium oscillate, making the crests and troughs 'stand in place'

#### Nodes and antinodes
In a standing wave, there are points that never move.
These are known as nodes and are spaced $\frac{\lambda}{2}$ apart.
Antinodes are halfway between these nodes, at the point of maximum displacement.

### Creating a standing wave
$\lambda_{m} = \frac{2L}{m}$
Where $m = \text{number of nodes} - 2$

Requirement for creation :: It must satisfy $\lambda_{m}$, it cannot be any other values
