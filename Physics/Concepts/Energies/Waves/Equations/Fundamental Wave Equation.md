$f = \frac{1}{T}$
$v = \frac{\lambda}{T}$
$v = f \lambda$

#### Characteristics
Includes angular frequency and amplitude

Period ($T$) :: Time for one cycle (in seconds)
Frequency ($f$) :: Number of cycles per second (Hz, hertz)
Wavelength ($\lambda$) :: Distance between peaks of a wave/t`xroughs of a wave (in metres)
Wave speed ($v$) :: Speed at which a particular wave type is propagated (velocity, $\ce{m/s^{2}}$)
Amplitude ($A$) :: The height of the wave
