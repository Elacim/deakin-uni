Sound is simply pressure variations.

Speed of sound in air :: $343$ $\ce{m/s^{2}}$
Sound must have a medium to travel, be it solid, liquid, or gas. It cannot travel in a vacuum.

$v \approx 331 + 0.6T$
$v = (331 \ce{m/s}) \sqrt{ \frac{T}{273 \ce{K}} }$
$v = (331 \ce{\frac{m}{s}) \sqrt{ \frac{293 \ce{K} }{273 \ce{K}} }}= 343$ $\ce{m/s^{2}}$

What is the sound equivalent of crests? :: Compressions
What is the sound equivalent of troughs? :: Rarefactions

What influences the speed of sound? :: Temperature, wind, and humidity
Temperature :: More heat = more expansion, more particles spread out giving more collisions
Humidity :: More water vapour = higher speed


#### Process of sound
1. A source, object, vibrates
2. This energy is transferred from the source as longitudinal sound waves
3. The sound is detected
