- [[Sound waves]] 

Intensity of a uniform spherical wave at distance $r$ from source of power $P_{source}$ :: $I = \frac{P_{source}}{4\pi4^{2}}$

Waves being spread out spreads energy too, decreasing intensity.
Intensity :: Energy transported by the wave per unit of time across some unit area, proportional to the wave's amplitude ($A^{2}$)
Intensity units : $W/m^{2}$ (watts per metre square)

##### Loudness
Threshold of hearing is $10^{-12} \ce{W/m^{2}}$, which is $0$ bel
Threshold of pain is $1 \ce{W/m^{2}}$

A sound $10\times$ louder than $0$ bel is $1$ bell, or $10$ decibels (dB)

| Sound sources       | Intensity  | Sound level (dB) |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| Jet (30m away)      | $10^2$     | $140$            |
| Air raid siren      | $1$        | $120$            |
| Pop music amplified | $10^{-1}$  | $115,85$         |
| Busy street traffic | $10^{-5}$  | $70$             |
| Conversation        | $10^{-6}$  | $60$             |
| Whisper             | $10^{-10}$ | $20$             |
| Rustling leaves     | $10^{-11}$ | $10$             |
Loudness is different to intensity. The ear doesn't respons linearly but logarithmically. A double in sound intensity results in a only slightly perceptible increase in loudness.

Decibels :: $\beta = (10 \ce{dB}) \times log_{10}(\frac{I}{I_{0}})$
$I$ :: The intensity to be measured (watts/metre squared)
$I_{0}$ :: Threshold of hearing ($1.0 \times 10^{-12}$)
The $log_{10}$ part gets it in bels

The sound intensity 0.25m away from a roaring lion is 0.250 w/m2. What is the sound intensity level in decibels?
$\beta = 10\ce{dB} \times log_{10}(\frac{0.25}{1.0\times10^{-12}})$
$\beta = 113.98 = 114$ decibels
