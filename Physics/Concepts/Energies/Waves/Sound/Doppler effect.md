- [[Electromagnetic spectrum]] 

As waves get bunched up while the emitting object is moving towards the observer, the observer perceives a higher frequency - pitch or light frequency

A truck moves towards you, is it's relative frequency higher or lower? :: Higher
A red photon moves away from you, is it's relative frequency higher or lower? :: Lower - it becomes 'redder' by shifting into the infrared spectrum


**Moving source, fixed observer**
Approaching source :: $f_{+} = \frac{f_{s}}{1- \frac{v_{s}}{v}}$
Receding source :: $f_{-} = \frac{f_{s}}{1+ \frac{v_{s}}{v}}$
$f_{+}$: The observed frequency is increased
$f_{-}$: The observed frequency is decreased
$f_{s}$ : source frequency in Hz
$v_{s}$ or $v_{0}$ : Speed of the *source* of the waves (m/s)
$v$ : Speed of the *waves* (m/s), usually $343$ $\ce{m/s^{2}}$

**Fixed source, moving observer**
Approaching observer :: $f_{+} = \left( 1 + \frac{v_{0}}{v} \right)f_{s}$
Receding observer :: $f_{+} = \left( 1 - \frac{v_{0}}{v} \right)f_{s}$

### Questions
**Fixed source, moving observer**
A flautist plays a 300Hz tone on their flute and are essentially stationary. If you are driving 100km/h, or 27.8m/s, what is the frequency you hear from the instrument before and after you pass them?

$f_{+} = \left( 1 + \frac{27.8}{343} \right)300$
-> $324.32=324$ Hz
$f_{+} = \left( 1 - \frac{27.8}{343} \right)300$
-> $275.69=276$ Hz


**Stationary observer, moving source**
You honk your horn also at 300Hz. What frequency does the flautist hear?
$f_{+} = \frac{300\ce{Hz}}{1-27.8 \div 343}$
-> $326.46 = 326$ Hz
$f_{-} = \frac{f_{s}}{1+v_{s}/v}$
-> $277.51 = 288$ Hz
