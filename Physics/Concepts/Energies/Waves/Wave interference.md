**Interference** :: When two or more waves pass through the same region and 'interfere' without alteration

**Reinforcement/constructive** interference :: Waves in the same phase grow larger

**Cancellation/destructive** interference :: Waves in opposite phases cancel each other out

How is interference measured? :: By using [[The Principle of Superposition]]
