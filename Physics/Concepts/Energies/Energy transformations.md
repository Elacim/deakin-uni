Vital to life
Our bodies take chemical energy and electrical energy into mechanical energy

Energy can be transformed from one type of energy to another in a system, like shown here:
![[Energy transformations - diagram.png|200]]

Energies to [[Thermal energy]] is a one-way street, meaning at least some energy is always lost

##### Examples
**Diver on a springboard** 
[[Elastic (spring) potential energy]] is converted into [[Kinetic energy]]. As the diver rises into the air, the kinetic energy is transformed into [[Gravitational potential energy]] 

**Weightlifter**
[[Chemical potential energy]] into [[Gravitational potential energy]] of the barbell

**Campfire**
Chemical energy in wood + oxygen -> [[Thermal energy]] in the hot gases/embers.
Electromagnetic radiation is also emitted by the hot gases
