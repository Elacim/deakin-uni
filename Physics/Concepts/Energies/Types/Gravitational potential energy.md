Gravitational potential energy ($U_{g}$) :: Stored energy due to height in a gravitational potential field

Potential energy ($mg \Delta h$) = Kinetic energy ($\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$)

$W = \Delta U_{g} = mg \Delta h$
$U_{g} = mgh$ joules

$m$ = mass
$g$ = gravity
$h$ = height

Gravitational potential energy is the same no matter the acceleration.


##### Examples
**Ball held above the ground**
A 10kg ball held 5m above the ground has a gravitational potential energy of...
$U_{g} = mg \Delta h$
$U_{g} = 10kg \times 9.81 \times 5m = 450.5J$

**Speed of ball in previous question given 40% thermal loss**
The ball loses 40% of it's speed from air resistance. How fast is it going?
$450.5J \times 0.6 = 294.3J$
$K_{e} = \frac{1}{2} m v^{2}$ -> $v^{2} = \frac{2K_{e}}{m}$
-> $v^{2} = \frac{2 \times 294.3J}{10} = 58.86$
-> $\sqrt{58.86} = 7.672\ce{m/s^{2}}$

**Locust takeoff**
A 2.0g locust takes off at 3.6m/s. If 50% of the initial $K_{e}$ is transformed to thermal energy, how high will the locus jump?
$Ke = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.002 \times 3.6^{2} = 0.01296J$
$\Delta g = mg \Delta h$
	- $\Delta h = \frac{U_{g}}{mg}$
	- $\frac{0.01296}{2} = 0.00648$
	- $h = \frac{0.00648}{0.002 \times 9.81}$
	- = 0.33cm
