Elastic (spring) potential energy ($U_{s}$) :: Stored energy due to the deformation from equilibrium of an elastic
	Bow and arrow, slingshot, elastic band

$k$ :: Spring constant ($N/m$), meaning it need $x(N)$ per metre
Force: Formula for spring force (Hooke's Law) :: $F = -k \Delta x$  ($x$ is in $\ce{m}$)
Energy: Elastic potential energy ($U_{s}$) :: $U_{s} = \frac{1}{2} k x^{2}$

Elastic potential energy x($U_{s}$) gets transformed to [[Kinetic energy]]

##### Examples
**Spiring**
A spring is has a constant of 20N/m and is stretched 4mm. What is the force? Stored energy?
$F = -k \times x$ -> $-20 \times \frac{4mm}{1000}$
-> $F = -0.08N$

**Muscle fibres**
100N to stretch 0.1mm. What is the equivalent spring constant of the muscle fibre?
$F = -kx$
-> $-\frac{F}{x} = x$
-> $- \frac{100N}{\frac{0.1}{1000}}= x$
$x = -1000000 = -10^{-6}N/m$
