**Thermal energy**
Thermal energy ($E_\theta$) :: Statistical measure of individual microscopic kinetic & potential energies of particles comprising a system
	Spin, translation, position, elasticity. i.e. Everything together including uncounted energies

System :: Any space under study with a boundary, e.g. photosynthesis reactions, e.g. a ball dropping
	e.g. Human, the skin is the boundary
System + surrounding \= ? :: Universe
