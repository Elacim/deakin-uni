Non-isolated systems always have some exchange of energy between itself and the environment.

The two primary energy transfer processes are **work** and **heat** 
**Work** :: Mechanical transference of energy to/from a system via pushing/pulling
**Heat** :: Non-mechanical transference of energy between a system and environment due to temperature differences
What exactly is heat? :: The vibration of particles

Work units :: Joules, or $1N$/$m$

Work represents the energy transferred into or out of a system.
Work can increase or decrease the energy of a system.
$\Delta E = \text{sum of energies} = \text{work } (W)$
Force is in the direction of displacement, which means positive work, the formula being:
	$W \times F \times d$, or $\ce{work = force \times distance}$

###### Examples of work
- An athlete doing work on a shotput, giving it kinetic energy
- A hand doing work on a match, giving it thermal energy
- A person doing work on a slingshot, giving it elastic potential energy
- A crate is pushed 3.0m at a constant speed with a force of 70N. How much work?
	- $w = 70N \times 3\ce{m} = 210N/m$ or $210J$
