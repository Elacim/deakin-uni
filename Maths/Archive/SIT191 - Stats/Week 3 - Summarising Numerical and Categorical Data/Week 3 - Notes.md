### Qualitative data
Benefits of pictures in data analysis :: Observations can be revealed that raw data makes vague, patterns, important features, and unexpected items, and a picture tells a thousand words - it is much easier to communicate through pictorial format

How tool allows data to be better interpreted for a wide audience? :: Pictures (diagrams, pictures etc.)

What tools are best used for presenting qualitative data? :: Frequency tables, contingency tables, pie charts, (stacked) bar charts

Frequency table features :: The counts of subjects
Relative frequency table features :: The percentages of subjects
What is a limitation of using relative frequency tables? :: It obscures the sample size
What is a major limitation of a table of data? :: It is hard to establish patterns

What do contingency tables allow? :: The comparison of two categorical variables

### Quantitative data
(Relative/Grouped) frequency tables

What are the measures of centre? :: Mean, median, and mode
What are the measures of spread? :: The range, IQR, and standard deviation



Formula for finding outliers
What are the formulas for finding outliers? :: Values less then $Q_{1} - 1.5 \times IQR$ or greater than $Q_{3} + 1.5 \times IQR$
What does $Q_{1} - 1.5 \times IQR$ tell us? :: It is the lower fence - values below this are outliers
What does $Q_{3} + 1.5 \times IQR$ tell us? :: It is the upper fence - values above this are outliers


Histogram:
Histogram hump name :: Modes
Histogram with one peak :: Unimodal
Histogram with two peaks :: Bimodal
Histogram with three+ peaks :: Multimodal
What would a histogram with 5 peaks be called? :: Multimodal

Negative skew - low x low y to high y high x
Positive skew - high y low x to high x low y

IQR: $Q_{3} - Q_{1}$

5 number summary:
Max
Q3
Median
Q1
Min

Boxplot - don't draw the max line past the upper fence
Outliers should be drawn as a dot/asterisk
