Problem .7 and .8 are about [[Linear Regression]] 

Q1 - [[Goodness-of-fit]] 
Q2 - [[Independence testing]]
Q3 - [[One-mean]] 
Q4 - [[Paired means]] 
Q5 - [[Two means]] 
Q6 - 

Question 7
Constant -> $b_{0}$ or y intercept
other -> $b_{1}$ or slope
'Sig.' -> p-value


Q8.

b) $Ŷ = -251.948 + 12.380x$
c) In book. The rough expected response when x=0
	FIX: Does not make sense to interpret as y-intercept is negative (weight cannot be negative)
d) For each inch of circumference, the bear is modelled to gain an additional 12.380 pounds. 

e)
H0 : There is no relationship between a bear's chest circumference and it's weight
HA : There is a relationship between a bear's chest circumference and weight
The p-value (0.000--) < the alpha of 0.05. 
The H0 is strongly rejected, favouring that there is indeed likely to be a relationship between chest circumference and weight. 



Q9) Deer thigh temperature to predict time of death
https://statskingdom.com/linear-regression-calculator.html
a) The scatterplot displays a strong linear relationship between thigh temperature and the time since death.
b) Ŷ = 40.9118 - 2.479X 
c) It is meaningful to interpret the y-intercept. The temperature at zero hours of death (x=0) would be ~41.9C. Though potentially a high temperature for a deer, this could be explained by a fever or a sunny day warming up the carcass, which are both possible events that may happen before a dead deer is found. This, I believe, makes it meaningful to interpret the y-intercept. 

d) 25$\degree$C = 40.9118 - 2.479x = 6.4186
It appears to be fairly reliable. It fits between 7 hours (24C) and 6 hours (27C) okay.
