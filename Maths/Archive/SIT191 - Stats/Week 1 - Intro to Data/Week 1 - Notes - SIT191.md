Monday/Thursday on-campus

What are statistics?
- reasoning, tools, methods
	- Understanding the world
- particular calculations made from data
- can be inference from data analysis
- all samples are imprecise due to variation
	- analysis and conclusions must incorporate result variability
- help us understand the world


Definition of a Population :: a collection of objects whose properties are to be analysed. e.g. all students attending Deakin
Definition of a Sample :: a subset or part of a population, e.g. a random selection of Deakin students
Definition of a Variable :: a characteristic about an element of a population or sample, e.g. the age of a student
Definition of a Data :: the specific observations or values of the variables, e.g 18 yrs & female, 20 yrs & male
Definition of a Explanatory variable :: a variable that is being manipulated by the researcher
Definition of a Response variable :: a variable whose values are to be compared between treatment groups

Definition of an Experiment :: A study with a planned activity that results in responses (data) to compare; manipulation of variables
Definition of an Observational study :: A study where no manipulation of variables or assignment to treatments - existing records are used
What is the main difference between experiments and observational studies :: Experiments involve variable manipulation while observation does not
Definition of a Parameter: :: A numerical characteristic that describes a population e.g. average age of all students
Definition of a Summary statistic :: A numerical characteristic that describes a sample, e.g. average age of a sample of Deakin students
Definition of an Data matrix :: A structure containing the raw data with a row for each person/case and a column for each variable


What is variable name for the X-axis on a graph? :: The independent or explanatory variable
What is variable name for the Y-axis on a graph? :: The dependent or response variable (as X advances, we get a new Y-value)
What is the explanatory/independent variable? :: The variable that is being manipulated by the researched (X-axis)
What is the response/dependent variable? :: The variable whose values are to be compared between treatment groups (Y-axis)

**Symbols - population parameters**
Average: $\mu$
Standard deviation: $\delta$

**Symbols - sample statistics**
Average: $\bar{y}$
Standard deviation: $s$


11% of a random sample of 100 people have a particular gene. It is thought that 15% of all people have the gene.
11% is a sample statistic
15% is a population parameter
The sample size (n) is 100

Average length of a worm species is 6.3mm. A random sample of 30 worms had a average length of 7.8mm.
6.3mm is a population parameter
7.8mm is sample statistic
n is 30


**Categorical variables**
1-10 surveys, postcodes, phone numbers - even though they are numbers, they are constants. e.g. 3331 always refers to Bannockburn, 2950 doesn't
Ordinal categorical - data can be compared as higher/lower, presented with a natural order
Grading (C, B-, B, A, A+...)
Nominal categorical - no sensible order
- transportation method/hair colour (blue, brown etc.)/postcode (3331, not East 3331), football player numbers

Numerical variables - quantitative values
Discrete numerical variables - discrete values like number of pets in households, shoe sizes (6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8... - there's no 6.142) - is constant
Continous


Fish species :: Nominal categorical
Fish length :: Quantitative (continuous numerical)
Number of eggs laid by birds :: Quantitative (discrete numerical)
Course students are enrolled in :: Qualitative (nominal categorical)
Final grade (HD, D, C, etc.) :: Qualitative (ordinal categorical)
Tax file number :: Qualitative (nominal categorical)



### The W's (and H)
At what point in data analysis should finding the 5 W's and H be done? :: As the first step

###### Counting  - Slide 11a
• When we count the cases in each category of a categorical variable, the counts are not the data, but something we summarise about the data.
• The shipping method categories are the What, and
• the individuals counted are the Who.

###### Who
Who does 'Who' refer to? :: Individual cases about which or from whom we have collected data, subjects, respondents, or experimental units
SLIDE 9a
###### What
What data is being collected
Qualitative/Quantitative
###### Why
SLIDE 10b
Why was the experiment/survey done? 
###### When
Context: Time
'Not given'/'Not stated'/'Unsure'/'Undeterminable'
###### Where
Context: Location 
'Not given'/'Not stated'/'Unsure'/'Undeterminable' 
###### How
How is the data collected: online, in-person surveys, observations


### Scatterplots
What is the purpose of scatterplots? :: To visually display and determine a statistical relationship between an explanatory (X) and response (Y) variable
What are the 3 characteristics of scatterplot data? :: Direction, form, and strength


**Direction**
What direction does a positive correlation go towards? :: From (leftmost, bottom) to (rightmost, top)
What direction does a negative correlation go towards? :: From (leftmost, top) to (rightmost, bottom
What is the line put on top of scatterplots named? :: The line of best fit

**Forms**
What types of relationships are there in scatterplots? :: Linear or curved (exponential, parabolic)
What does the term 'association' mean? :: It refers to the form of a scatterplot without referencing linear/curved specifically
True or False: Curved forms have no line of best fit. :: True. There can not be a positive and negative direction like curved forms have

**Strength**
What levels of strength are there for statistical relationships? :: Very weak... moderate... very strong
What does a statistically very strong strength scatterplot look like? :: Data points are closely clumped together and follow the line of best fit closely
#### Questions
What correlation type is altitude to atmospheric pressure an example of? :: A negative linear correlation - as altitude increases, pressure drops
What correlation type is the hours spent studying to grade percentage an example of? :: A positive linear correlation - as hours spent studying increases, grades increase
