What is bias? :: The (un)intentional misrepresentation of data through poor design, random chance, or malicious manipulation

**Producing relevant and reliable data**
- Don't trust anecdotal evidence
	- Studies
	- Experiments
	- Surveys
	- Simulations
- Samples should be big enough and randomly chosen
	- Reduce bias
	- Best representation
	- Calculations in sample statistics should give a fair estimate of the population parameters

Names for members of a population/sample :: Members, individuals
Subgroups of a population names :: Strata
### [[Sampling methods]]


### Observational studies
Slide 6b-7b
What does an observational study always entail? :: The observation and data collection of a single or group of individuals without treatments
What is the main benefit from observational studies? :: Discovering trends and establishing potential relationships
What are the main drawbacks of observational studies? :: They cannot show a cause-and-effect and confounding variables are rife

What is a retrospective study? :: Research of past records is done on a patient after they have already selected
What is a prospective study? :: Patients are selected from known and continually collected data

### Experiments`
What do experiments allow researchers to prove? :: They prove or disprove a causal relationship through a controlled environment
What must experiments have to prove a causal relationship? :: It must have at least one pair of two variables. One to be manipulated, the x, and the other to be measured, the y.
What three basic things do all experiments entail? :: Manipulating the independent (x) variable, random assignment of treatments, and comparison of results between treatments

What is the name for the individuals that are experimented on? :: Experimental units or more often subjects/participants for humans 
What is the term for the values of a treatment (e.g. 10°C, 20°C, 30°C)? :: The levels of the factor

What is a treatment? :: The combination of specific levels from all factors that an experimental unit receives 

- [[Four principles of Experimental Design]]

Migraine sufferers:
	2 factors:
		- Pain reliever and placebo
			- Level 1 (dose given)
			- Level 2 (no dose, placebo pill)
	  - Water temperature
		  - Level 1 (ice water)
		  - Level 2 (room temp water)
	Group 1 - pill + ice water
	Group 2 - pill + regular water
	Group 3 - no pill (placebo pill) + ice water
	Group 4 - no pill (placebo pill) + regular water
Find group count by multiplying factor count and levels (here it'd be 2 factors $\times$ levels/factor = 4 groups) - this is also the treatment count

- `3x2 = 6 treatments`

#### Blinding
- if we know where an experiment is heading, we can be biased
- Those who could influence the results ***or*** by those who evaluate the results

Meaning of single-blind :: An experiment where either the subjects or researcher does not know on who the treatment(s) was assigned
Meaning of double-blind :: An experiment where both the subject **and** researches does not know on who the treatment(s) was assigned

##### Placebo
Why are placebos given? :: When a treatment of any kind is applied, an improvement can be measured. By administering a placebo in a set percent of the subjects, we can both eliminate false-positives and act as a control, by testing if it is having the same effect as the given treatments
What is the purpose of a placebo? :: To minimise bias in subjects


As applying a treatment can give a positive effect
