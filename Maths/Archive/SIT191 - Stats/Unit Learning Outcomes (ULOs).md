||**These are the Learning Outcomes (ULO) for this unit.  <br>At the completion of this Unit, successful students can:**|
|**ULO 1**|Calculate and construct suitable numerical and graphical summaries to describe and interpret data.|
|**ULO 2**|Apply knowledge of probability to solve problems related to various distributions.|
|**ULO 3**|Apply techniques of statistical inference to analyse data involving proportions, means and associations|
|**ULO 4**|Use statistical software to generate and interpret relevant output for quantitative data.|

After working through this unit, you will be able to:
- Choose and calculate or construct suitable numerical and graphical summaries for data
