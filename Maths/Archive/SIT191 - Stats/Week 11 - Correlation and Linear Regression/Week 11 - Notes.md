If a scatterplot shows an apparent linear relationship between variables, the correlation is calculated
What does correlation measure? :: The strength of a linear relationship
What does linear regression provide? :: An equation for predicting response values from explanatory variables

Regression inference :: The use of sample estimates from the regression equation to make inferences about the population parameters

Positive values = bottom left to top right

Association :: How close the values are to each other
What would a scatterplot with a strong association and low correlation appear as? :: Close together points and a non-linear relationship (such as in a curve)
Correlation :: The measurement of a linear relationship's strength and direction between two quantitative variables

Lurking variable :: A hidden variable that affects both variables in a relationship; unwanted

Correlation range for strong negative :: $-1..-0.7$
Correlation range for moderate negative :: $>-0.7..<-0.4$
Correlation range for weak :: $-0.4..+0.4$
Correlation range for moderate positive :: $>+0.4..+<0.7$
Correlation range for strong positive :: $+0.7..+1$

Formula for calculating the correlation coefficient (NOT ASSESSABLE)
?
$r = \frac{ \sum\limits z_{x}z_{y} }{ n-1 }$ or $\frac{ \sum\limits (x-\bar{x})(y-\bar{y}) }{ (n-1)s_{x}s_{y} }$

[[Residuals]] 

**Outliers**
- Report correlations with/without the outlier(s)

What does $r^{2}/R^{2}$ mean? :: It is the fraction of the data's variance that is accounted for by the model - it is a percentage
e.g. 0.69 = 69% of data is explained by the $r^{2}$ model, 31% isn't
What does $1-r^{2}$ calculate? :: The fraction of original variance left in the [[Residuals]] 

Always report the $R^{2}$ and $y=mx+c$ equation

H0 : No linear relationship OR slope = zero
HA : There is a linear relationship OR slope != zero


#### Regression assumptions and conditions
Quantitative variables condition :: Only done on two quantitative variables
Straight enough condition :: Relationship should be at least somewhat linear
Outlier condition :: Take note of outliers and exclude them if they mislead the relationship
