Formula for finding the $[x_{low}, x_{high}]$ confidence intervals?
?

The confidence interval overlaps with the true population proportion
90% of the time, 

In a normal distribution, 95% of the data is within $\pm 1.96$ $\sigma$ of the mean 
	This means we are 95% confident that the confidence interval will capture the proportion of the population

**One proportion**
We are 95% confident that the true proportion of people who tried this new exercise routine and presented with >=5% weight loss is between 82.76% and 89.76% 

**Mean**
There is a 95% chance that the confidence interval of \[292.75, 307.25] contains the true population mean weight of turtles.
#### Two proportions

$p_{1} - p_{2}$
We are 98% sure that the traditional diet ($p_{1}$) results in-between $0.9\%..6.6\%$ more second heart attacks than the Mediterranean diet ($p_{2}$)

$p_{2} - p_{1}$
We are 98% sure that the Mediterranean diet ($p_{2}$) results in-between $0.9\%..6.6\%$ less second heart attacks than the traditional diet ($p_{1}$)
