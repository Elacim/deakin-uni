What does $H_{0}$ mean? :: The null hypothesis
What does $H_{A}$ mean? :: The hypothesis/alternative hypothesis
What is the alternative hypothesis? :: The values given that are considered plausible assuming the $H_{0}$ is rejected

When the probability of deviation (P-value) is low, what does this indicate? :: That the data has a low probability to deviate from the expected values and the $H_{0}$ incorrect if above $\alpha$ 
When the probability of deviation (P-value) is high, what does this indicate? :: That the data has a high probability to deviate from the expected values and the $H_{0}$ correct if below $\alpha$

What $H_{A}:\text{parameter}$ is a two-sided alternative hypothesis? :: $H_{A} : \text{parameter} \neq \text{hypothesised value}$
What is a two-sided alternative hypothesis? :: Either side of the $H_{0}$ value is plausible
What values can be P-value in $H_{A} : \text{parameter} \neq \text{hypothesised value}$? :: The probability of deviating in either direction of the $H_{0}$ value 

Which two $H_{A}:\text{parameter}$s are the one-sided alternative hypotheses? :: $H_{A} : \text{parameter} < \text{hypothesised value}$ and $H_{A} : \text{parameter} > \text{hypothesised value}$

Is $p_{1} > p_{2}$ one or two-sided? Why? :: One sided as the probability points to one side (`|------>xxxx|` - `x = valid data, - = invalid`)
Is $p_{1} < p_{2}$ one or two-sided? Why? :: One sided as the probability points to one side (`|xxxxxx<----|` - `x = valid data, - = invalid`)
Is $p_{1} \neq p_{2}$ one or two-sided? Why? :: Two sided as the probability is every value but one (`|xxxxxx-xxxx|` - `x = valid data, - = invalid`)

What is the difference of **two** proportions in a typical hypothesis test? :: $H_{0} : p_{1} - p_{2} = 0$
