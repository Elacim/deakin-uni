What is $\alpha$ (alpha)? :: The probability threshold to reject/accept the $H_{0}$
How can you calculate the alpha in a one-sided test? :: $\alpha = \frac{100 - \text{confidence interval}}{2}$
How can you calculate the alpha in a two-sided test? :: $\alpha = 100 - \text{confidence interval}$ 


What does P-value mean? :: The probability that the data point value could occur given $H_{0}$ being correct; i.e. the probability of deviation away from the null hypothesis value
