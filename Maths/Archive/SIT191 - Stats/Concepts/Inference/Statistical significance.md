Theory aside, what does it mean when a test is statistically significant? :: It purely means the P-value is lower than the $\alpha$ 
Does statistical significance have an impact? :: 
•Don't be lulled into thinking that statistical significance necessarily carries with it any sense of practical importance or impact.


• For large samples, even small, unimportant ("insignificant") deviations from the null hypothesis can be statistically significant.
• On the other hand, if the sample is not large enough, even large, financially or scientifically "significant" differences may not be statistically significant.
• It's good practice to report the magnitude of the difference between the observed statistic value and the null hypothesis value (in the data units) along with the P-value on which we base statistical significance.
