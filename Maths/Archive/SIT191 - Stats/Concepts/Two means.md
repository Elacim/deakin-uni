DF = n1 + n2 - 2

Test statistic equation :: $\ce{\frac{(\mu1 - \mu2)}{\sqrt{ \frac{s^{2}_{1}}{n_{1}} + \frac{s^{2}_{2}}{n_{2}} } } }$
#### Requirements
For two groups:
- two known sample sizes
- two means
- two standard deviations
	- [When SD is unequal calculator](https://www.statskingdom.com/150MeanT2uneq.html)
	- [When SD is equal calculator](https://www.statskingdom.com/140MeanT2eq.html)

#### Example
23 men, 35 women

|       | Mean | Std. Dev. |
| ----- | ---- | --------- |
| Women | 105  | 12        |
| Mean      | 115     | 15          |

#### Confidence interval
$\ce{ (\mu1 - \mu2) \pm t^{*}_{n1 + n2 - 2} * \sqrt{ \frac{s^{2}_{1}}{n_{1}} + \frac{s^{2}_{2}}{n_{2}} }}$
We are 90% confident that the average increase in systolic blood pressure in men is between \[5.16, 14.84] mmHg
