[Z-test vs T-test](https://www.analyticssteps.com/blogs/what-are-differences-between-z-test-and-t-test)
[Z-test](https://www.statskingdom.com/110MeanNormal1.html) if population mean and/or $\sigma$ is known
[T-test](https://www.statskingdom.com/130MeanT1.html) if only sample info is known

$\bar{y}$ : Mean
$t^{*}_{n-1}$ : Critical value
$s$ : Standard deviation
Once the plus and minus are calculated, we get a confidence interval, then,
	State: We are x% confident that the average count of y is between \[lower interval, high interval]
 
##### Requirements
- An expected value to be constant
- A random sample of $n$ amount
- An average
- A standard deviation

###### Finding $t^{*}_{n-1}$
1. Find the degrees of freedom ($n-1$)
2. Find the confidence value (e.g. 95%)
3. Match these up on the [[T-tables.pdf]]

##### Results
Calculating the equation twice, once adding and the other subtracting (for the $\pm$), we get a confidence interval.
