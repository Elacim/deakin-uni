What are the two categories of sampling methods? :: Random and non-random
Types of Random sampling :: Simple random, systematic, stratified, cluster, and multistage (Descriptions on Slide 5a)
Types of Non-Random sampling :: Convenience, volunteer, judgement, and purposive sampling
##### Random sampling
What is SRS? :: Simple random sampling
Simple random sampling (SRS) explanation :: Each individual has an equal chance of being chosen
Systematic random sampling explanation :: Choose a random member of a data set, then at a set interval ($x$), a sample from the population is taken; if using a list, the whole population must be there
Stratified random sampling :: A population is divided into groups and from those groups, a percentage of each is taken 
Cluster sampling :: A population is divided into groups, then one or more groups is chosen as the sample
Multistage sampling :: The compilation of multiple sampling methods in a row (e.g. Systematic then Stratified)

##### Non-random sampling
Convenience sampling explanation :: Data units are selected from ease of access

Volunteer sampling explanation :: A set set of questions set by a researcher answered by any amount of and by any individuals
Weaknes(ses) of volunteer sampling :: Individuals with strong opinions are most likely to answer 
Judgement sampling explanation :: A sample of a population is chosen based on researchers belief of best representation
Weaknes(ses) of judgement sampling :: The researchers may have biases and be inaccurate in their choices
Purposive sampling explanation :: A sample is chosen based on what a researcher think will be the best fit for the study
