Testing for the independence of two categorical values from both variables in a table.

This is done by examining the counts for one **group** of individuals (not simply result 1-treatment 1 count, it's result 1-treatment 1 & 2 count).

| Names | Treatment 1 | Treatment 2 | **TOTAL** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Result 1 |  |  | Group count |
| Result 2 |  |  | Group count |
| **TOTAL** | Group count | Group count | Overall |

Degrees of freedom calculation:
$\ce{ DF = Rows - 1 \times Columns - 1 }$
