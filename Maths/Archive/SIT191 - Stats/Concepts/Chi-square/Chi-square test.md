Chi-square tests are used for [[Hypothesis testing]].
Observed values not matching expected leads to large, positive number

There are two types of $\chi^{2}$ tests: Goodness-of-fit and independence tests

What is a goodness-of-fit test? :: A test to determine if the counts of one categorical variable matches a given model

When doing independence tests (I think two columns and two rows), use the `Independence (Association)` thing instead of `Goodness-of-fit`
