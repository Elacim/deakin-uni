**How to read**
The (I) variety shows the group is currently the focus and what will be compared to the groups in (J).
So, in (I), 1 is being compared to 2 (which is on average -0.3160 less than 1) and to 3 (which on average is -0.2480 less than 1)

In (I) 3, 1 is 2.480 more than 3, and 2 is -0.0680 less than 3

(I-J) means group (I) minus group (J)
