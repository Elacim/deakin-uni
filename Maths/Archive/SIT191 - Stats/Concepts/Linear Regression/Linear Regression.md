- [[Residuals]] 

https://statskingdom.com/linear-regression-calculator.html

Association :: How close the values are to each other
What would a scatterplot with a strong association and low correlation appear as? :: Close together points and a non-linear relationship (such as in a curve)
Correlation :: The measurement of a linear relationship's strength and direction between two quantitative variables
Lurking variable :: A hidden variable that affects both variables in a relationship; unwanted
Regression inference :: The use of sample estimates from the regression equation to make inferences about the population parameters


Extrapolation should be considered as potentially useful but as unreliable

What does $r^{2}/R^{2}$ mean? :: It is the fraction of the data's variance that is accounted for by the model - it is a percentage
e.g. 0.69 = 69% of data is explained by the $r^{2}$ model, 31% isn't

What does $1-r^{2}$ calculate? :: The fraction of original variance left in the [[Residuals]] 

Always report the $R^{2}$ and $y=mx+c$ equation

Correlation range for strong negative :: $-1..-0.7$
Correlation range for moderate negative :: $>-0.7..<-0.4$
Correlation range for weak :: $-0.4..+0.4$
Correlation range for moderate positive :: $>+0.4..+<0.7$
Correlation range for strong positive :: $+0.7..+1$


#### Regression assumptions and conditions
Quantitative variables condition :: Only done on two quantitative variables
Straight enough condition :: Relationship should be at least somewhat linear
Outlier condition :: Take note of outliers and exclude them if they mislead the relationship
