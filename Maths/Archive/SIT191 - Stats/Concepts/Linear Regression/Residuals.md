Positive residual position on line of best fit:: Below
Negative residual position on line of  best fit :: Above

Above the line, they are negative residuals

The hope, when fitting a regression model, is to not see any pattern or trend
	It should be random

What do residuals allow us to see? :: If the model is appropriate to the data


**Calculating residuals**
Calculate the x value using the slope equation THEN minus it from the observed
$\ce{residual = observed - predicted}$
