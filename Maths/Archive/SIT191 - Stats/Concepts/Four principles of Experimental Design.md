What are the four principles of experimental design? :: Control, randomise, replicate, and though not necessary, blocking (groups)
What is control? :: The controlling of extraneous variables to make conditions as equal as possible between subjects
What is randomise? :: The randomisation of subject selection and treatment application to equalise variation sources
What is replication? :: The repetition of an experiment's treatments on different subjects
What is the term for an experiment done on a single individual? :: An anecdote - it's not valid data
What is blocking? :: The segmentation of a sample into groups then randomising those groups for the purpose of reducing variability
