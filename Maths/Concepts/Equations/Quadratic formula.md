$x= \frac{ -b \pm \sqrt{ b^{2} - 4ac } }{ 2a }$
The quadratic formula is comprised of two parts, the vertex rule and the determinant

**Vertex rule**
$\frac{-b}{2a}$ is the vertex rule. This calculates the x-coordinate of the turning point/stationary point/vertex of the parabola.

$- \frac{-x}{2} \div 2 = \frac{x}{4}$


**Determinant**
$\sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}$
The determinant is a useful guide to determine if a quadratic formula has any [[Real numbers|real solutions]].
If it is a positive number, it will have solutions
	e.g. $\sqrt{5^{2} - 4(1)(3)} = \sqrt{25-12} = \sqrt{13}$ has at least one solution
Negative numbers don't as square roots can't have negative numbers
	e.g. $\sqrt{-16}$ has no real solutions
