An inclusive end of an interval is shown by $\geq$, $\leq$, and $[$ $]$ symbols.
An exclusive is shown by $>$, $<$, and $($ $)$ symbols.

The syntax using equalities is $x$ surrounded by two symbols, like so:
	$\ce{number_{1} < x < number_{2}}$
		From $\ce{number_{1}}$ (not including) to $\ce{number_{2}}$ (also not including)
The syntax with brackets is:
	$\ce{[number_{1}, number_{2})}$
		This means from and including $\ce{number_1}$ up to $\ce{number_{2}}$ (not including)


##### Number-line
A hollow end means exclusive
A filled-in end means inclusive
