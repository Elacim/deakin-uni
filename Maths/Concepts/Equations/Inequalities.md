If solving and going from negative to positive or vice versa, you gotta swap the $\geq$, $<$ sign etc.

$x^{2}+6x - 8 < x^{2} + 7x - 18$
-> $\cancel{x^{2}} + 6x - 8 < \cancel{x^{2}} +7x - 18$
-> $\cancel{6x} -8 + 18 < x \cancel{-18}$
-> $10 < x$
Meaning, $x$ must be above $10$ to break even

##### Taking the reciprocal
$a > b$  -> $\frac{1}{a} < \frac{1}{b}$

##### Why do you flip the sign when multiplying by a negative number?
Take $-2 < 5$. This statement is true as $5$ is greater than $-2$.
Multiplying both sides by $-1$, we get $2<-5$, a clearly untrue statement - $-5$ is not greater than $2$.
So, when multiplying by a negative number, we flip the sign:
	$-2 < 5 \leftrightarrow 2 > -5$
