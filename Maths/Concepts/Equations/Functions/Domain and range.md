#### Domain
**Finding domains**
$y=\sqrt{\frac{11}{9x+12}}$
$9x + 12$
We want to be able to have $-12 + 12$, so we need to manipulate $x$ to get this.
-> $-\frac{12}{9} \times 9 + 12 = 0$
$x>- \frac{12}{9}$

#### Range



### Questions
##### $y=-2 - \sqrt{5x-10}$
Square roots can't be negative but can be zero.
-> $\sqrt{5x-10}$
-> $\sqrt{5(\frac{10}{5})-10}$ 
-> $\sqrt{10-10} = \sqrt{0}$
So, $x$ must be greater than or equal to $\frac{10}{5}$

The range will always be a negative number as we are minusing an always positive square from the constant $-2$.
$y \leq -2$



#### Explainer of how to find the domain
For a refresher, A function like $f(x) = \sqrt{4x}$ must have the $\sqrt{}$ value be $\geq 0$ to avoid complex numbers, and a square root can be any positive number. So we have a domain of $0 \leq x \leq \infty$. 

A function like $f(x) = 0.048x(5-x)$ requires some thinking. We want to find the values that *are* $=0$ but not below $0$
Turning $x$ to $0$ gets $0 \times (5-0) = 0$.
Turning $x = 5$ gets $0.048\times5(5-5) = 0.24\times(0) = 0$.

$x$ can be $0 \leq x \leq 5$.

To verify, we can try some extreme values:
- Turning $x = 6$ gets $0.048\times6(5-6) = 0.288\times(-1) = -0.288$.
	- Invalid as PDF values must be $\geq 0$
- Turning $x = -1$ gets $0.048\times-1(5--1) = -0.048\times(6) = -0.288$.
	- Invalid as PDF values must be $\geq 0$
