$y=\sqrt{\frac{11}{9x+12}}$
$9x + 12$
We want to be able to have $-12 + 12$, so we need to manipulate $x$ to get this.
-> $-\frac{12}{9} \times 9 + 12 = 0$
$x>- \frac{12}{9}$

##### $y=-2 - \sqrt{5x-10}$
Square roots can't be negative but can be zero.
-> $\sqrt{5x-10}$
-> $\sqrt{5(\frac{10}{5})-10}$ 
-> $\sqrt{10-10} = \sqrt{0}$
So, $x$ must be greater than or equal to $\frac{10}{5}$

The range will always be a negative number as we are minusing an always positive square from the constant $-2$.
$y \leq -2$
