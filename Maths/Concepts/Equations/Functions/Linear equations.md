? :: A constant change in $x$ results in a constant change in $y$
Appearance on graphs :: Straight line
General syntax :: $ax + by = c$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants. It most commonly is $y = mx + c$
Number of solutions :: Infinite (each point on the straight line is a solution)

y-intercept :: $c$, or the value of y
Gradient :: $m$, $\ce{\frac{rise}{run}}$, or $\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$

How to determine what's a linear equation :: If $x$ or $y$ is not raised to a higher power

Relationship of $x$ and $y$ :: They are inversely related

##### y=\# or x=\# questions
When a question asks for the gradient of a $y=\#$, this will output a horizontal bar. 
A gradient of $x=\#$ would be a straight vertical line.

##### Finding a linear equation from two points
$y=mx + c$
Given $(-2,4)$ and $(-1, 1)$, what is the linear equation?
1. Find the gradient
	1. $\frac{1-4}{-1--2} = \frac{-3}{1}$
	2. $= -3$
	3. $y=-3x + c$
2. The equation must satisfy the given points, so substitute the $x$ and $y$ values
	1. $(-2,4)$ into $y=-3x + c$
	2. $4=-3(-2)+c$
3. Solve for this new equation
	1. $4=-3(-2)+c$
	2. $4 = 6 + c$
	3. $c = -2$
4. Compile the equation
	1. $y = -3x - 2$

##### Equation from only a gradient and a point
Point: (10,36)
Gradient: -6

From this, we can build the equation into the $y=mx+c$ format
-> $36 = -6(10) + c$
-> $c = 36+60 = 96$
