Given a triangle of $r$



![[Trigonometry - 5-4-x cos triangle.png|200]]
$\cos(\theta)=\frac{x}{5}$
$x^{2} + 4^{2} = 5^{2}$
-> $x^{2} = 25 - 16$
-> $x = \sqrt[]{9}$
$x=3$
$\cos(\theta)=\frac{3}{5}$

How are we supposed to know this?
It is one of the [[Special (standard) triangles]] with $45\degree:45\degree:90\degree$ angles with a $1:1:\sqrt[]{2}$ ratio between the sides.
As the ratio is the same, we can say for certain that the $\theta$ is $45\degree$ or $\frac{\pi}{4}$

Find $x,y$. In this example, $\sin\theta = \frac{1}{2}$
$\sin\theta = \frac{y}{10} = 0.5$
-> $10 \times 0.5 = 5$
$y=5$

$x = \sqrt[]{10^{2} - 5^{2}}$
-> $100 - 25 = 75$
-> $x = \sqrt[]{75}$
-> $75 = 25 \times 3$
-> $\sqrt[]{25} \sqrt[]{3}$
$x = 5\sqrt[]{3}$

**What is the angle?**
It matches a [[Special (standard) triangles]], specifically the one with the $2:\sqrt[]{3}:1$ sides ratio.
If we divide the ratio of the sides, $10:5:5\sqrt[]{3}$, by $5$, we get the special triangle ratio. 
Therefore, the angle must be one of $30\degree:60\degree:90\degree$.
