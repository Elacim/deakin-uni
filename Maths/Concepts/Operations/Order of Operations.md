**In each step, we work from <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">left to right</mark>, performing that step's operations in order.**
1.  Evaluate any _groups_ in the expression. Follow the order of operations for each group.
2.  Evaluate all _exponentials_ (powers) and _roots_.
3.  Evaluate any _multiplication_ and _division_.
4.  Evaluate any _addition_ and _subtraction_.

**Stuck deciding what to operate on next?**
An example is $0=2\cos(x)$.
It seems wrong to divide $\frac{0}{2}$ but it also seems wrong to $0 \times cos^{-1}$...
The correct thing to do here is the $\frac{0}{2}$.
Prefer division by constants.
