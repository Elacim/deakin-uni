The difficulty we've had with cancelling like-terms is telling when we can do it.

$\frac{x^{2}}{x} \rightarrow x$ is ok but $\frac{x+1}{x} \rightarrow 1$ isn't?
This is because we can only cancel according to the [[Order of Operations]].
$\frac{1x}{x} \rightarrow 1$ works.
$\frac{xy}{x}$ doesn't work as $xy$ is a term.
$\frac{x*y}{x}\rightarrow y$ works as $x$ and $y$ are separate.

$\frac{5(x-2)}{9x^{2} + 7(x-2)} \rightarrow \frac{5}{9x^{2}+7}$ doesn't work as the $y(x-2)$ is being added, not multiplied
$\frac{5(x-2)}{9x^{2} \times 7(x-2)} \rightarrow \frac{5}{9x^{2}\times7}$ does though as it is being multiplied 


#### Solving the seemingly simple $x + \frac{3x}{24} = 11$
**Intuited, incorrect thought**
$x + \frac{3x}{24} = 11$
-> $x+3x = 11 * 24$
-> $4x = 264$
-> $x = \frac{264}{4}$
$x = 66$

We're multiplying the whole side, even when doing division. 
Because there's a $+$ instead of a $\div/\times$, we don't simply cancel out the term.

**Actual right answer**
$x + \frac{3x}{24} = 11$
-> $24\left(x + \frac{3x}{24}\right)= 24(11)$
-> $24x + 3x = 264$
-> $27x = 264$
-> $x = \frac{264}{27}$
$x = \frac{88}{9} = 9.7\dot{7}$
