$e^{x}$ :: Plug in time and get the growth
	-> $e^{\text{rate } \times \text{ time}}$
$ln(x)$ :: Plug in growth, get time to achieve growth


$ln(30)=3.4$ means that given that at $100$% return, 
-> $e^{3.4 \times 100\%} = 30\times$ growth

**If we want $30\times$ growth and have a return of $5\%$, how many years?**
-> $ln(30) = 3.4$
-> $\text{rate} \times \text{time} = 3.4$
-> $0.05 \times \text{time} = 3.4$
-> $\text{time} = \frac{3.4}{0.05} = 68$ years
Think of it like: $ln(30)=3.4$, so at $100\%$ growth, it will take $3.4$ years to reach $30 \times$ growth.
