Multiplication of growth becomes addition of time
Division of growth becomes subtraction of time.

**Why does $ln(1) = 0$?**
Phrase the question as "How long would it take to achieve 1$\times$ growth" - it would take $0$ time units to reach where you are currently

**How do you get fractional time?**
By flipping the fraction then taking the negative, like:
$ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \rightarrow -ln(2) = -0.693$

**Why add logarithms when multiplying?**
Thinking in terms of growth, a growth factor of $20\times$ can be thought of as $2 \times 10, 5 \times 4,$ or even $3 \times 6.666$ growth.
We can wait a factor of $2$ then a factor of $10$ or $10$ then $2$, but the result will still be the end result of $20\times$
