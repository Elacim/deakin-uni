Otherwise known as the Zero-factor principle or any similar variation between the two. 

If $ab = 0$, then either $a = 0$,  $b = 0$, or both.

A use case is to find the $x$-intercepts for a cubic by reducing it to a quadratic.

##### Example
[[8.2D#Task 2 Differentiation - Sketching graphs]] 
$y = 2x^{3}+5x^{2}−7x$

$0 = 2x^{3}+5x^{2}−7x$

**Factor out $x$**
$0 = x(2x^{2} + 5x - 7)$
> $x = 0$ or 
> $x = 2x^{2} + 5x - 7$ 

**Find the quadratic**
$0 = 2x^{2} + 5x - 7$
$x= \frac{ -(5) \pm \sqrt{ (5)^{2} - 4(2)(-7) } }{ 2(2) }$
-> $\frac{ -5 \pm \sqrt{ 25 + 56 } }{ 4 }$
-> $\frac{ -5 \pm \sqrt{ 81 } }{ 4 }$
-> $\frac{ -5 \pm \sqrt{ 81 } }{ 4 }$
-> $x^{\pm} = \frac{-5\pm9}{4}$
$x^{+}= 1$
$x^{-} = -3.5 = - \frac{7}{2}$

**$x$-intercepts**
> $x_{1} = 0$, $x_{2}=1$, and $x_{3}= -\frac{7}{2}$


#### Explanation
When factoring '$x$' out of the equation, you are left with the product of two terms: $x$ and another expression. When we set this equation equal to 0, it means that either one or both of these terms must equal zero for the equation to be true.

This is based on the zero-product property, which states that if a product of two or more factors is equal to zero, then at least one of those factors must be equal to zero. In mathematical terms: if $ab = 0$, then either $a = 0$,  $b = 0$, or both.
