#### 1: Rocket launch
A rocket is fired from a platform 10 metre from the ground. The
distance of the rocket from the ground at time t seconds is
$s = -10t^{2} + 99t + 10$ for $t \in [0, 10]$

**What is the velocity and acceleration of the rocket?**
$s' = -20t + 99$
$s'' = -20$


**What was the maximum distance that the rocket travelled from the ground? And at what time did this occur?**
$s = -10t^{2} + 99t + 10$ for $t \in [0, 10]$
$-10(10)^{2} + 99(10) + 10$
-> $-1000 + 990 + 10$
$= 0$m 


$s' = -20t + 99$
-> $0 = -20t + 99$
-> $t = \frac{-99}{-20}$
$t = 4.95$


**How do you know that this is the maximum and not the minimum distance?**


**What is the velocity when $t=5$?**
$-20(5) + 99$
$= -1$


#### Filling a water tank
It takes 15 minutes to fill a water tank. The volume $V$ litres after
t minutes is given by
$V = 30t - t^{2}$ where $t \in [0,15]$

What is the volume at t = 0 and at t=15?
$V = 30(0) - 0^{2}$
-> $V = 0$

$V = 30(15) - 15^{2}$
-> $350 - 225$
$= 125$L

Find the instantaneous rate of change of volume when t=8
$V' = 30 - 2t$
$30 - 2(8)$
$=14$L/t

Find the instantaneous rate of change of volume when t=10
$V' = 30 - 2(10)$
$10$L/t

Is the instantaneous rate of change increasing or decreasing? How does this relate to $V''$?
It is decreasing.


Find the volume of water in the tank when the instantaneous rate of change of volume is 10.
$V' = 30 - 2t$
-> $0 = 30 - 2t$
-> $-30 = -2t$
$V = 15$L

### Object displacement
The displacement $s$ metres of an object at time $t$ seconds is given by
$s = -8t^{3} + 24t^{2} + 32t$ for $t \geq 0$

**Find the velocity and acceleration**
Velocity: $s' = -24t^{2} + 48t + 32$
Acceleration: $s'' = -48t + 48$

**Find the velocity when $t=2$**
$-24(2)^{2} + 48(2) + 32$
-> $-96 + 96 + 32$
$= 32$$\ce{m/s^{2}}$

**Find the acceleration at $t=3$**
$-48(3) + 48$
-> $-96$$\ce{m/s^{2}}$

**Find the velocity when acceleration is $0$**
$0 = -48t + 48$
-> $t = 1$

$v = -24(1)^{2} + 48(1) + 32$
-> $-24 + 48 + 32$
$v = 56$ $\ce{m/s^{2}}$

**Find the acceleration and displacement when the velocity is $50$$\ce{m/s^{2}}$**
$50 = -24t^{2} + 48t + 32$
-> $0 = -24t^{2} + 48t - 18$
