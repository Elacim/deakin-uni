? :: The approximation of the gradient of the line ([[Tangent|tangent]]) that 'just touches' a given point

What does it mean for $h$ to approach $0$ (zero)? :: The second point, $x+h$ is being brought closer and closer to the first point, $x$, making the gradient closer and closer to the tangent of $x$. This is written as $\lim_{h\to0}$

$\lim_{h\to0} = \frac{ f(x + h) - f(x) }{ h  }$

Notation :: $\frac{dy}{dx}$, $f'(x)$ or $y'$

First principles/gradient-finding formula
?
$f'(x) = \lim_{h\to0} \frac{ f(x + h) - f(x) }{ h  }$

Alternative to the first principles formula :: The [[Calculus rules]] allow us to quickly find solutions



| Function            | Derivative               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| $f(x) = e^{kx}$     | $f'(x) = ke^{kx}$        |
| $f(x) = \ln(x^{p})$ | $f'(x) = \frac{p}{x}$    |
|                     | $f'(x) = \frac{}{x^{2}}$ |

$f(x) = n\frac{z}{x} = n(\frac{z}{x})^{n-1} = nzx^{n-1} =$
