Derivative gives us the gradient at a given point.
Finding stationary points:
1. Find the derivative
2. Find the values of $x$ when derivative $=0$
3. For each value of $x$, find the corresponding values of $y$

Classifying stationary points:
1. Find the derivative of the derivative (known as the second derivative or $f''(x)$)
2. Evaluate $f''(x)$ at the $x$ value of the stationary point
	1. If $f''(x) < 0$, then it is a local maximum
	1. If $f''(x) > 0$, then it is a local minimum
	1. If $f''(x) = 0$, then the sign test has to be used

##### Sign test
The sign test is simply treating $x$ as any value $>0$, $<0$, or $=0$. This can be any positive or negative value, it doesn't matter the size of the set $x$ value.

It is a local minimum as the left side is descending downwards $(-)$ into the stationary point ($0$) which then it ascends $(+)$. Same but reverse for the local maximum: It ascends ($+$) until the point $(0)$ then it descends $(-)$.

**Interpreting the sign test results**
1. $+, 0, -$ = a local maximum 
2. $-, 0, +$ = a local minimum 
3. $+,0,+$ OR $-,0,-$ = horizontal point of inflection
