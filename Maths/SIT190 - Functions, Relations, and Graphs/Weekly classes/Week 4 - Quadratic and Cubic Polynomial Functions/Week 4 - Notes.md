What is the area of the square with sides of length x?
What is the area of the square with side of length x + a?
What is the area of the square with sides of length x — a?
What is the area of the rectangle with sides x — a and x + a?


Slide 18
1. Rearrange the equation so that one side is 0.
2. Factorise the quadratic on the other side.
3. The quadratic is zero, if at least one of the factors is zero, so
each factor separably for x.


[[Completing the square]] 


$y=-x^{2} + 9x - 20$
Shape: Parabola
y-intercept: $-20$
x-intercept: 

-> $f$
Discriminant: $\sqrt{9^{2} - 4(-1)(-20)} = \sqrt{1}$
