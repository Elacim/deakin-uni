Antikythera - 2000 year old computer used for tracking the sun/moon/planet paths

Thales measured pyramids using the sun, a rod (person), and a shadow which made a right angle triangle.
$\frac{H}{h} = \frac{B}{b} \rightarrow H = \frac{Bh}{b}$

The ratio of the sides of two triangles, like 
$\frac{a_{1}}{a_{2}} = \frac{b_{1}}{b_{2}} = \frac{c_{1}}{c_{2}}$

Which of these are similar?
![[Week 6 - Notes - similar triangles.png|200]]
$T_{1}$ compared to $T_{2}$: $\frac{T_{1}}{T_{2}}$
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{2}{2\sqrt{3}}$
$0.577 = 0.577 = 0.577$. They are therefore similar.

$T_{3}$ to $T_{2}$: $\frac{T_{3}}{T_{2}}$
$\frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{3} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}$
$0.288 = 0.288 = 0.288$. The triangles are therefore similar.
This means that $T_{1}, T_{2}, \& T_{3}$ are similar

$T_{3}$ to $T_{4}$: $\frac{T_{3}}{T_{4}}$
$\frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{3} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{1}{2}$
$0.288 = 0.288 = 0.5$. The triangles aren't similar.

Similar triangles with the same ratios have angles with the same size.
Increasing all sizes by the same amount doesn't affect the angles.

Chord of an angle :: Line connecting two points of a circle separated by that angle
-> $chord(\theta) = 2\sin (\frac{\theta}{2})$ per $7.5\degree$


**How to find $\cos(\theta)$ when $\sin(\theta)$ is known**
$\cos\left(\theta - \frac{\pi}{2}\right)= \sin(\theta)$
Need $\sin^{2}(\theta) + \cos^{2}(\theta)=1$

**Finding length of a triangle's side when the other two lengths are known**

**Finding the last angle in a triangle given two other knowns**
$\theta_{3} = 180 - \theta_{1} - \theta_{2}$

**Finding angles of a triangle with sides $4,4, 4\sqrt{2}$**

**Find the angle in a triangle when it's opposite = 4 and adjacent = 5**
[[SOH CAH TOA]] - specifically $\tan(\theta) = \frac{4}{5}$

**Finding the sign of $\cos(\theta)$ when $\theta$ is in the 3rd quadrant**
[[Unit circle - Quadrants]] 
The sign is negative.


Angle $\theta$ satisfies $\sin(\theta) = \frac{-\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $\cos(\theta)= \frac{1}{2}$
Distance $d$ is the length of the hypotenuse

$\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}$
-> $\theta = \arccos(\frac{1}{2})$
$\theta = 60\degree$ 

$d =\frac{2}{\cos(20 \times \frac{\pi}{180})}= 2.1283555450$
