Antikythera - 2000 year old computer used for tracking the sun/moon/planet paths

Thales measured pyramids using the sun, a rod (person), and a shadow which made a right angle triangle.
$\frac{H}{h} = \frac{B}{b} \rightarrow H = \frac{Bh}{b}$

The ratio of the sides of two triangles, like 
$\frac{a_{1}}{a_{2}} = \frac{b_{1}}{b_{2}} = \frac{c_{1}}{c_{2}}$

Which of these are similar?
![[Week 6 - Notes - similar triangles.png|200]]
$T_{1}$ compared to $T_{2}$: $\frac{T_{1}}{T_{2}}$
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{2}{2\sqrt{3}}$
$0.577 = 0.577 = 0.577$. They are therefore similar.

$T_{3}$ to $T_{2}$: $\frac{T_{3}}{T_{2}}$
$\frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{3} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}$
$0.288 = 0.288 = 0.288$. The triangles are therefore similar.
This means that $T_{1}, T_{2}, \& T_{3}$ are similar

$T_{3}$ to $T_{4}$: $\frac{T_{3}}{T_{4}}$
$\frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{3} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{1}{2}$
$0.288 = 0.288 = 0.5$. The triangles aren't similar.

Similar triangles with the same ratios have angles with the same size.
Increasing all sizes by the same amount doesn't affect the angles.
