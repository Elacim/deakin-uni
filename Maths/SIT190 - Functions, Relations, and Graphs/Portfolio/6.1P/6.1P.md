# Task 1: Give it a go
![[6.1P - Give it a go 1.png|200]]

I kept getting tripped up on the radian -> degree conversion.
I am struggling to understand the purpose of the $\sin/\cos$ ratio

# Task 2: Trigonometry
![[6.1P - Task 2 - Figure 1.png]]

### 1) Draw the two special triangles
%% [[Special (standard) triangles]]  %%
![[6.1P - Task 2 Q1 - Special triangle drawings.png]]

##### a) Explain how special triangles can be used to solve triangle $A$'s angles
The two main special triangles don't align with Triangle $A$ and therefore cannot be used to solve these triangles' angles.
$\tan(\theta) = \frac{3}{4}$
-> $\theta = \arctan(\frac{3}{4})$ 
$\theta = 0.6435$ radians $= 36.87\degree$

$\phi = 180 - 90 - 36.87\degree = 53.13\degree$
$\phi = \pi - \frac{\pi}{2} - 0.6435 = 0.9272952180$


##### b) Explain how special triangles can be used to solve triangle $B$'s angles
The two main special triangles don't align with Triangle $B$.
$\tan(\alpha) = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}$
-> $\alpha = \arctan( \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} )$
$\alpha = 1.1303$ radians 

$\beta = \pi - \frac{\pi}{2} - 1.1303 = 0.4405$ radians

##### c) Explain using a special triangle to find $\cos(\frac{\pi}{6})$, giving the answer too
%% [[SOH CAH TOA]] %%
The special triangle with sides ratio $1:\sqrt{3}:2$
We can decide the smallest angle, and apply the formula $\cos(\theta) = \ce{\frac{adjacent}{hypotenuse}}$
-> $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 0.8660$
-> $\cos(\frac{\pi}{6}) = 0.8660$

If the bigger angle is chosen, we can apply $\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$
-> $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 0.8660$
and get the same answer.

### 2) Find the length of side $c$ in Triangle $C$ in figure 1
$c=\sqrt{ x^{2} - b^{2} }$
-> $c = \sqrt{ 4^{2} - 2^{2} }$
-> $c = \sqrt{ 16 - 4 }$
-> $c = \sqrt{ 12 }$

### 3) Find the angle $\delta$ in Triangle $C$ in radians
$\tan(\delta) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{12}}$
-> $\delta = \arctan(\frac{2}{\sqrt{12}})$
= $0.524$ radians

### 4) Find the length of side $a$ in Triangle $D$ in figure 1
$c=\sqrt{ a^{2} + b^{2} }$
-> $c = \sqrt{ \sqrt{13}^{2} + 7^{2} }$
-> $c = \sqrt{ 13 + 49 }$
$c = \sqrt{ 62 } = 7.874$ 

### 5) Find the angle $\gamma$ in Triangle $D$ in radians
$\sin(\gamma) = \frac{\sqrt{13}}{7}$
-> $\gamma = \arcsin(\frac{\sqrt{13}}{7})$
$= 0.541$ radians

### 6) Convert $21\degree$ to radians
%% [[Radians vs. Degrees]]  %%
$21\degree \times \frac{\pi}{180\degree} = 0.367$ radians
### 7) Convert $\frac{\pi}{5}$ radians to degrees
$\frac{\pi}{5} \times \frac{180}{\pi} = 36\degree$


# Task 3: Functions and relations
### 1) Give the domain and range of the following
%% [[Domain and range]] %%
##### a) $y=\frac{2}{x+3}$
Division can be any value except for $0$. We can force a zero into the equation by finding what will make $x$ cancel out the $3$ and find $\frac{2}{0}$
$x+3 = 0$
-> $x = -3$
The domain is therefore $x \neq -3$

A division can result in any value, even $0$ if the numerator is $0$, like $\frac{0}{x+3}$. Since it isn't, the range can be anything except $0$
The range is therefore $y \neq 0$

##### b) $y= \frac{23}{\sqrt{5-x}}$
A real square root cannot be negative and the denominator cannot be $=0$
$5-x = 0$
-> $-x = -5$
$x = 5$
$x$ therefore cannot $=5$ as $\sqrt{5-5}=\sqrt{0}=0$ which will create a division-by-zero error. It also cannot be any value above $5$ like $\sqrt{5-6} = \sqrt{-1}$ as this will create a complex number.
Therefore the domain is $x > 5$

As a real square root will always produce a positive number and as the division will prevent values of $0$, the range is
$y > 0$


### 2) Show that $x^{2} + y^{2} = 49$ is not a function
%% [[Functions]] %%
A requirement of functions is that every $x$ value has only one $y$ value. This equation is not a function, it is a relation - $x^{2} + y^{2} = 7^{2}$ that will create a circle.

$x^{2} + y^{2} = 49$
-> $x^{2} + 0^{2} = 49$
-> $x^{2} = 49$
$x = \pm 7$

Take the value of $x=0$ for example:
$x^{2} + y^{2} = 49$
-> $0^{2} + y^{2} = 49$
-> $y=\pm\sqrt{49}$
$y = \pm 7$

The $y$ value is $7$ or $-7$, meaning one value of $x$ is equal to at least two values of $y$ and therefore eliminating it from being a function.
