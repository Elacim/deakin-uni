# Task 1: Give it a go


# Task 2: Trigonometry


# Task 3: Functions and relations
### 1) Give the domain and range of the following
%% [[Domain and range]] %%
##### a) $y=\frac{2}{x+3}$
Division can be any value except for $0$. We can force a zero into the equation by finding what will make $x$ cancel out the $3$ and find $\frac{2}{0}$
$x+3 = 0$
-> $x = -3$
The domain is therefore $x \neq -3$

A division can result in any value, even $0$ if the numerator is $0$, like $\frac{0}{x+3}$. Since it isn't, the range can be anything except $0$
The range is therefore $y \neq 0$

##### b) $y= \frac{23}{\sqrt{5-x}}$
A real square root cannot be negative and the denominator cannot be $=0$
$5-x = 0$
-> $-x = -5$
$x = 5$
$x$ therefore cannot $=5$ as $\sqrt{5-5}=\sqrt{0}=0$ which will create a division-by-zero error. It also cannot be any value above $5$ like $\sqrt{5-6} = \sqrt{-1}$ as this will create a complex number.
Therefore the domain is $x > 5$

As a real square root will always produce a positive number and as the division will prevent values of $0$, the range is
$y > 0$


### 2) Show that $x^{2} + y^{2} = 49$ is not a function
%% [[Functions]] %%
A requirement of functions is that every $x$ value has only one $y$ value. This equation is not a function, it is a relation - $x^{2} + y^{2} = 7^{2}$.

$x^{2} + y^{2} = 49$
-> $x^{2} + 0^{2} = 49$
-> $x^{2} = 49$
$x = \pm 7$

The $x$ value is $7$
