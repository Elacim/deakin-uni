# 9.3D
Due to an excessive amount of rain, the village dam is filling at a rate of $310(11 + 3t)$ litres an hour $(t ≥ 0)$. The mayor is planning to evacuate the village before the dam overflows, flooding the valley. The amount of water currently in the dam is $3,090,000$ litres and the mayor wants to know how many hours it will take for the dam to be completely full. The dam is $60$ metres long, $20$ metres wide and $10$ metres deep. You can assume that the villagers are not using any of the dam water and there is no water loss through evaporation.

**Information we have**
$310(11 + 3t)$ litres an hour $(t ≥ 0)$
- Currently $3,090,000$ litres at (presumably) hour zero
- Dam is $60\times20\times10$ metres
### 1) What is the maximum capacity of the dam in litres? 
Hint: $1000L = 1\ce{m}^{3}$

The dam is $60\times20\times10$ metres $= 12,000\ce{m}^{3}$.
Since $1\ce{m^{3}} = 1000L$, 
-> $12,000\ce{m^{3}} \times 1000L = 12,000,000L$

The maximum capacity of the dam is $12$ million litres.


### 2) Find the function that gives the number of litres in the dam at time $t$ hours. 
We are at hour zero and the dam is at $3,090,000$ litres full. 

Since the equation $\frac{L}{t} = 310(11 + 3t)$ gives the litres/hour (litres/t in this) when what we want is only the litres given a time, that must mean it detects the change in gradient and therefore is a derivative of an equation. It is likely not a double-derivative as the omniscient mayor has not mentioned any acceleration of the rainfall (and there is no extra constant).

$310(11 + 3t)$, $t \geq 0$
-> $\int(3410 + 930t)dt$
-> $\frac{3410}{1}t^{0+1} + \frac{930}{2}t^{1+1} + C$
$= 3410t + 465t^{2} + C$

If we evaluate this integral for $t=0$...
-> $3410(0) + 465(0)^{2} + C$
-> $0 + 0 + C$
$f(0) = C$
All we get is $C$. Hour zero should have the starting $3,090,000$ litres, so $C$ must be exactly that. Now the equation gives the correct answer.

**Final equation to find $L$**
$L = 465t^{2} + 3410t + 3,090,000$, $t \geq 0$

### 3) The village mayor wants to have the town evacuated before the dam is full. At what time $t$ would the dam be full?
Litres-given-time equation: $L = 465t^{2} + 3410t + 3,090,000$
Max capacity: $12,000,000L$

Since we want to find the time, we plug the maximum capacity we found earlier into the equation and turn the equation into a quadratic:
$12,000,000 = 465t^{2} + 3410t + 3,090,000$
-> $0 = 465t^{2} + 3410t + 3,090,000 - 12,000,000$
-> $0 = 465t^{2} + 3410t - 8,910,000$
-> $t= \frac{ -(3410) \pm \sqrt{ ( 3410 )^{2} - 4( 465 )( -8,910,00 ) } }{ 2( 465 ) }$
-> $t= \frac{ -3410 \pm \sqrt{ 11,628,100 + 16,572,600,000 } }{ 930 }$
-> $t= \frac{ -3410 \pm \sqrt{ 16,584,228,100 } }{ 930 }$
$t^{+} = \frac{ -3410 + \sqrt{ 16,584,228,100 } }{ 930 } \approx 134.81$ hours
$t^{-}= \frac{ -3410 - \sqrt{ 16,584,228,100 } }{ 930 } \approx -142.14$ hours
We can discard negative times both as they don't make sense in this context and due to the parameter of $t \geq 0$.

So, the time it would take for the dam to entirely fill up would be $\approx 134.81$ hours which is $\approx 5.62$ days, or more precisely, $\frac{ -3410 + \sqrt{ 16,584,228,100 } }{ 930 }$ hours.

In common language, it is approximately 5 days, 14 hours, 48 minutes, 22 seconds, and 319ms.

Days and hours: $\frac{134.80619}{24} = 5.6169245833$ days, $5$ days and $134$ $\ce{mod}$ $24  =14$ hours.
Minutes: $0.806... \times 60 = 48$ minutes and $0.371..$
Seconds $0.371.. \times 60 = 22$ seconds and $0.319$
Milliseconds: $0.319.. \times 1000 = 319$ milliseconds and $0.5338...$

$533$ microseconds
$866$ nanoseconds
$523$ picoseconds
$502$ femtoseconds
$881$ attoseconds
$754$ zeptoseconds
$626$ yoctoseconds
$409$ rontoseconds
$56483154264857495$ quectoseconds ($10^{-30}$)
...and...
$7196715351536936...$ Planck time ($10^{-44}$)

Or put in a more digestible format, 
$5\ce{d}:14\ce{h}:48\ce{m}:22\ce{s}:319\ce{ms}:533\ce{\mu s}:866\ce{ns}:523\ce{ps}:502\ce{fs}:881\ce{as}:754\ce{zs}:626\ce{ys}:$ $409\ce{rs}:$ $56483154264857495\ce{qs}:$ $7196715351536936..\ce{t_{P}}$

I hope this is a good enough approximation for the mayor. Imagine if I got this wrong after all that... the mayor would not be happy with me.
