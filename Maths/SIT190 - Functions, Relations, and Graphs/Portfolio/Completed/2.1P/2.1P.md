**2a)** I achieved full marks on both quizzes. I completely forgot how to do the $x=5$ and $y=4$ questions while in the second quiz attempt.

**2b)** I aim to consult with Jonathan so I can understand how to best answer them. I will also perform a brief review on these simple types of graphs.

**2c)** The question was to do with finding the gradient of $x=5$ and $y=4$. I performed my strategy answered in 2b to complete the second quiz successfully.

**4\)** I did not perform as fast as I would have hoped in the second attempt. I spent an extra ~4 minutes on those questions I felt I should have understood. My strategy did work in a way though as I understood the question on a deeper level. I should focus on speed.


#### Task 2 - Equation of a Line
\1. Convert $3x-5y=-10$ into $y=mx+c$
-> $3x-5y=-10$
-> $-5y = -10 - 3x$
-> $y = \frac{-10-3x}{-5}$
-> $y = 2 - \frac{-3x}{5}$
-> $y=\frac{3}{5}x + 2$

\2. Give the gradient of this line and explain how it was found.
The gradient is $\frac{3}{5}$, rise is $3$ and run is $5$ per $x$ increase. I found it through the known format $y=\text{gradient} \times x + \text{y-intercept}$

\3. Give the y-intercept of this line and explain how it was found.
The y-intercept is $+2$, found through the known format of $y=\text{gradient} \times x + \text{y-intercept}$.

\4. Find the x-intercept, showing all working.
$y=\frac{3}{5}x + 2$
-> We set $y$ to zero to find where $x$ will intercept the $x$-axis
-> $0 = \frac{3}{5}x + 2$
-> $-2 = \frac{3}{5}x$
-> $-2(5) = 3x$
-> $\frac{-10}{3} = x$
-> $x = \frac{-10}{3}$

\5. Sketch the line, identifying the x-axis, y-axis, x-intercept, y-intercept, and the origin

#### Task 3 - Simultaneous equations
##### Q1
$$
\left\{
\begin{array}{1}
	(1): 3x-7y=-2 &\\
	(2): \text{ }5x+3y=4
\end{array}
\right.
$$

###### Elimination method
*Solving for y:*
$3x-7y = -2$
	-> times 5 = $15x - 35y = -10$
$5x + 3y = 4$
	-> times 3 = $15x + 9y = 12$

$15x-35y = -10$
minus
$15x + 9y = 12$
-> $-44y = -22$
-> $y = \frac{-22}{-44}$
-> $y=\frac{1}{2}$

*Solving for x:*
$3x - 7\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)= -2$
-> $3x - 3.5= -2$
-> $3x = -2+3.5 = 1.5$
-> $x = \frac{1.5}{3}$
-> $x = \frac{1}{2}$

*Verification*
$3(0.5) - 7(0.5) = 1.5 - 3.5 = -2 = -2$

###### Substitution method
$3x - 7y = -2$
$5x + 3y = 4$

*Re-arranging for x*
$3x - 7y = -2$
-> $3x = -2 + 7y$
-> $x = \frac{-2+7y}{3}$

*Substituting into equation 2 to find $y$*
$5x+3y=4$
-> $5\left(\frac{-2+7y}{3}\right)+3y= 4$
-> $\frac{-10+35y}{3} + \frac{9y}{3} = 4$
-> $\frac{-10 + 44y}{3}=4$
-> $-10 + 44y = 12$
-> $44y = 22$
-> $y = \frac{1}{2}$

*Finding x*
$5x + 3\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)= 4$
-> $5x + \frac{3}{2} = 4$
-> $5x = \frac{8}{2} - \frac{3}{2} = \frac{5}{2}$
-> $x = \frac{5}{2} \div \frac{10}{2}$
-> $x = \frac{5}{2} \times \frac{2}{10}$
-> $x = \frac{10}{20}$
-> $x = \frac{1}{2}$

###### Reflection
I found the elimination method magnitudes easier than the substitution method. I spend literal hours trying to find what I was doing wrong with it. It truly challenged me on my understanding of how to manipulate equations, taking it slow, and double-checking answers. Often I reached answers incongruent with the elimination method and CAS calculators like $y=\frac{23}{18} = 1.2778$. The result of all these wrong answers was a poor understanding of how fractions are added together. I learnt a few lessons, like now knowing to simplify often and to not 'double-up' on multiplications.






##### Q2
$$
\left\{
\begin{array}{1}
	2x-8y = -3 &\\
	3x-2y = -5
\end{array}
\right.
$$

###### Elimination method
$2x - 8y = -3$
$3x-2y=-5$
	-> times 4 to $12x - 8y = -20$

$2x - 8y = -3$
minus
$12x - 8y = -20$
-> $-10x = 17$
-> $x = \frac{17}{-10}$
-> $x = - \frac{17}{10}$

*Finding y*
$2(-\frac{17}{10})-8y = -3$
-> $-\frac{34}{10} - 8y = -3$
-> $-8y = \frac{-30}{10} + \frac{34}{10}$
-> $-8y = \frac{4}{10}$
-> $y = \frac{4}{10} \div \frac{-80}{10}$
-> $y = \frac{4}{10} \times \frac{10}{-80}$
-> $y = \frac{40}{-800}$
-> $y = -\frac{1}{20}$

*Verification*
$2\left(\frac{-17}{10}\right) - 8\left(\frac{-1}{20}\right)= -3$
-> $\frac{-34}{10} + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{4}{10}$
-> $-34 + 4 = - \frac{30}{10}$
-> $-3 = -3$

###### Substitution method
$2x - 8y = -3$
$3x-2y=-5$

*Isolating $x$*
$2x - 8y = -3$
-> $2x = -3 + 8y$
-> $x = \frac{-3+8y}{2}$
-> $x = \frac{-3}{2} + 4y$

*Finding y*
$3x - 2y = -5$
-> $3\left(\frac{-3}{2} + 4y\right)- 2y = -5$
-> $-\frac{9}{2} + 12y - 2y = -5$
-> $10y = - \frac{10}{2} + \frac{9}{2}$
-> $10y = - \frac{1}{2}$
-> $y = -\frac{1}{20}$

*Finding x*
$2x - 8y = -3$
-> $2x - 8\left(-\frac{1}{20}\right) = -3$
-> $2x + \frac{8}{20} = -3$
-> $2x = - \frac{60}{20} - \frac{8}{20}$
-> $2x = -\frac{68}{20}$
-> $x = -\frac{34}{20}$
-> $x = \frac{-17}{10}$

###### Reflection
This time, I struggled with both methods, finding them equally as challenging. I keep making silly little mistakes like missing a negative sign that I am blindsided by later on in the equation. As I do have a CAS calculator, I can confirm if my answers are actually correct and find where I went wrong. I will be better at these as I go on so I'm not too worried.


##### Q3. 
$$
\left \{
	\begin{array}{1}
		9x-3y = 21 &\\
		21x - 7y = 49
	\end{array}
\right.
$$
**I chose the elimination method**
$9x-3y = 21$
-> times 7 = $63x-21y=147$
$21x - 7y = 49$
-> times 3 = $63x-21y=147$

$63x-21y=147$
$63x-21y=147$
-> $0x + 0y = 0$
There are infinite solutions as the lines are co-linear, meaning on each point of one of the lines, the other point is also there, leading to infinite points of intersection.
