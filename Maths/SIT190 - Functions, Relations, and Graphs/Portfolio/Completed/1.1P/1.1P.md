### Task 1 - Give it a go, and give it a go again
Give it a go and give it a go again respectively:
![[Week 1 - Tasks - Give it a go.png|200]]![[Week 1 - Tasks - Give it a go again.png|200]]

I also did them as moodle quizzes first. I am unsure of what it correct to submit. My next answers are based off of the moodle answers.

**1.3:** I performed much stronger than I thought I would on the first give-it-a-go quiz. The only mistake I actually made was forgetting to remove an 'x' on the final question. The other questions I got wrong were due to the moodle rules being finnicky and hard to understand (I did exactly what it asked me to do and it still didn't accept it).
I intend to double-check every question with 'solve for x' to make sure I don't accidentally leave the x in. 

**1.4:** I fixed my previous mistake and then made another silly one on an earlier question by rushing through too fast. I got the answer mostly correct, simply missed a 'y'. 
I followed my strategy perfectly but forgot to think outside it. I was caught up trying to not make the same mistake that I went and made a sillier mistake. I must be more careful with rushing ahead.

### Task 2 - Goal setting
1. The Luchas
2. Some goals of mine are to reach a moderate level of proficiency with mental arithmetic and to understand mathematical functions on a deeper level. I expect to not excel at this class but I do want to have a high standard at the work I do.
3. A knight is my best suit then.
4. A strength is that I can be extremely dedicated (read: stubborn) at achieving goals once I set my mind to it which will greatly assist me in staying motivated to improve. 
5. I do not have a strong affinity for mathematics. I know I need to improve at it for future career goals so I intend to practice nearly every day at math problems and ask for help from the teacher for when I am truly stuck. Furthermore, I need to think about the problems rather than ignore what I don't know.

### Task 3 - Algebra
**(1) Use the rule a(b + c) = ab + ac to expand 7(x + 2)** 
$a(b+c)=ab + ac$
- $7(x+2) = 7x + 7 \times 2$
- $\rightarrow 7x + 14$

**(2) Use the rule ab − ac = a(b − c) to factorise 7x − 28** 
$ab-ac = a(b-c)$
- $7x-28 = 7(x-c)$
- $c = \frac{28}{7} = 4$
- $\rightarrow 7(x-4)$


**(3) Simplify the following mathematical expressions:****
- **$\frac{4}{16} - \frac{30}{32}$
	- $\frac{4}{16} \times 2 = \frac{8}{32}$
	- $\frac{8}{32} - \frac{30}{32} = 8-30 = -22$
	- $\frac{-22}{32}$, $\div 2$
	- $\rightarrow \frac{-11}{16}$
	
- $\frac{7}{11} \div \frac{5}{3}$
	- Flip the second fraction to turn the equation into multiplication
	- $5\left(\frac{7}{11}\right) \times 11\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)$
	- $\frac{35}{55} \times \frac{33}{55} = \frac{1155}{3025}$
	- Since 55 is 'doubled', we can divide by it to get the numerator: $\div 55 = 21/55$

**(4) Solve for $x$:**
- $2x + 9 = 5$
	- Minus 9: $2x = 5-9 \rightarrow 2x = -4$
	- Divide by $x$'s coefficient (2): $x=\frac{-4}{2}$
	- $x = -2$
- $6 - \frac{x}{2} = 6$
	- Minus 6: $-\frac{x}{2} = 6-6 \rightarrow -\frac{x}{2}=0$
	- Times by -2: $x = 0 \times -2$
	- $x = 0$

**(5) Evaluate the following expression $y=12 - 5x$ when $x=-2$** 
$y = 12 - 5(-2)$
- $y = 12 - -10 \rightarrow y=12 + 10$
- $y = 22$
