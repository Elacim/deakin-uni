### Task 1 - Give it a go

![[3.1P - Give it a go 1.png|200]] ![[3.1P - Give it a go again.png|220]]

2a) I struggled understanding the domain questions until I asked for help. The other questions I took a fair amount of time to get through but I did understand them. The multiplication of matrices is confusing for me and that is where I got a question wrong.
b) I intend to study more intently on how matrices multiply and pay close attention to adding negatives. My notes are fairly comprehensive on how to multiply, I simply do not comprehend it at times. 
c) It was the final question where I had to multiply two matrices together. I did it nearly correctly but forgot to account for negatives while adding all the multiplications per column. 

**Reflection**
I improved on my mistake made on the first attempt of the give it a go quiz and correctly multiplied the matrix on the last question. This time I was significantly faster (improved by 20 minutes) too. I am starting to understand the domain/range questions better now too. My strategy therefore did work.


### Task 2 - Matrices
![[3.1P - Task 2 matrices.png]]

a) $A+D$
$A$ is $2 \times 2$ whereas $D:2 \times 3$, meaning they cannot be added or subtracted by each other. They would have to be identical in size to add.

b) $A+E$
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
    28 & 1 \\ 
    3 & \frac{1}{4}
\end{bmatrix}
+
\begin{bmatrix}
    6 & 4 \\ 
    -5 & 3
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
    28+6 & 1+4 \\ 
    3+-5 & \frac{1}{4}+ \frac{12}{4}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
    34 & 5 \\ 
    -2 & \frac{13}{4}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

c) $B+D$
$B$ is $3\times2$ which cannot be added/subtracted by a matrix with non-identical dimensions, such as $D$ being $2\times3$

d) $A \times B$
$A$ has dimensions of $2\times2$ and $B: 3 \times 2$. 
For matrices to be multiplied, the columns of the first matrix must be identical to the rows of the first matrix. In this case, $A_{column} (2) \neq B_{row} (3)$.

e) $B \times A$
$$
\begin{bmatrix}3 & 0 \cr -6 & 0 \cr 2 & 7\end{bmatrix}
\times
\begin{bmatrix}28 & 1 \cr 3 & \frac{1}{4}\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
    3(28)+0(3) & 3(1)+0(\frac{1}{4}) \\ 
    -6(28)+0(3) & -6(1)+0(\frac{1}{4}) \\
    2(28)+7(3) & 2(1)+7(\frac{1}{4})
\end{bmatrix}
$$
$$
= \begin{bmatrix}84 & 3 \cr -168 & -6 \cr 77 & \frac{15}{4}\end{bmatrix}
$$


f) $C \times A$
$C: 2\times3$ whereas $A: 2\times 2$. $C$'s columns ($3$) do not match $A$'s rows ($2$)

g) $12D$
$$
12 \times \begin{bmatrix}3 & \frac{1}{4} & \frac{5}{2} \cr \frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{2} & \frac{3}{4}\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}36 & \frac{12}{4} & \frac{60}{2} \cr \frac{12}{2} & \frac{12}{2} & \frac{36}{4}\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}36 & 3 & 30 \cr 6 & 6 & 9\end{bmatrix}
$$


h) $C-12D$
$$
\begin{bmatrix}0 & 3 & -5 \cr 6 & 0 & 4\end{bmatrix}
-
\begin{bmatrix}36 & 3 & 30 \cr 6 & 6 & 9\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
    -36 & 0 & -35 \\ 
    0 & -6 & -5
\end{bmatrix}
$$
