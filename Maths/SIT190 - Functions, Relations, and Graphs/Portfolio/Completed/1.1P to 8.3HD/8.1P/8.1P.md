# Task 1: Give it a go quizzes
![[8.1P - Give it a go 1.png|200]]![[8.1P - Give it a go 2.png|200]]

I struggled immensely with the final problem. I do not know if I calculated that how it should have been calculated. I found that the equation I used to figure out the speed ($9t+7$) must have been the first derivative (as $y'$ = velocity), further evidenced by the acceleration being a constant $9$ $\ce{m/s^{2}}$, the second derivative.
I figured there could not have been another constant as the question did not state any, so I backtracked $y'$ using the power rule but in reverse. 
$9t \to \frac{9}{n}t^{1+1} = \frac{9}{2}t^{2}$ and $7 = 7t^{0} = 7t^{0+1} = 7t$ to get $9t^{2} + 7t$ as the primary $y$ equation.

I am going to aim to understand what I did, which I understand to be what integrals are. The week 10 class will cover this so I will prepare for then.

I improved significantly between attempts, mainly because I roughly knew how to execute the last question properly. Again, I found the anti-derivative which unearthed the answer. I am studying integrals in preparation now and I realise they are similar to what I have been attempting. I am extremely happy that I thought of doing the $y'$ to $y$ without knowing about how to use integrals first as it feels like I discovered a piece of calculus myself through my practice in this trimester.


# Task 2: The Derivative

### 1) For each of the following functions, identify which rule (the product rule, quotient rule or chain rule) you would use to differentiate the function and why.

##### a) $y = \cos( x^{\frac{2}{5}} + 2 )$
I would use chain rule as there is a nested function, $\cos$ and within it, $x^{\frac{2}{5}}$.
##### b) $g(x) = \frac{\ln(x^{3})}{x}$
I would use the quotient rule as it involves dividing functions. I may also employ the chain rule for the natural log

##### $f(x) = e^{3x} \times \sin( \frac{x}{15} )$
I would use the product rule as the functions are being multiplied. 


### 2) Use the product rule to differentiate
%% [[Product Rule]] %%
$y = e^{2x} (3x^{5} - x^{2})$

$u = e^{2x}$
$u' = 2e^{2x}$

$v = 3x^{5} - x^{2}$
$v' = 15x^{4} - 2x$

$u\times v' + v \times u'$
-> $e^{2x} \times (15x^{4} - 2x) + (3x^{5} - x^{2}) \times 2e^{2x}$
-> $15x^{4}e^{2x} \times -2e^{2x}x + 6x^{5}e^{2x} \times -2x^{2}e^{2x}$
$= -30x^{5}e^{4x} + -12x^{7}e^{4x}$


### 3) Use the quotient rule to differentiate
%% 
[[Quotient Rule]]
[[Derivatives of trigonometric functions]] 
%%
$y = \frac{\tan(3x)}{3x-9}, x \neq 3$

$u = \tan(3x)$
$u' = 3\sec(3x)^{2}$

$v = 3x-9$
$v' = 3$

$f'(x) = \frac{vu' - uv'}{v^{2}}$

$\frac{ (3x-9)\times 3\sec(3x)^{2} - \tan(3x) \times 3 }{ (3x-9)^{2} }$
-> $\frac{ 3(3x-9) \times \sec(3x)^{2} - 3\tan(3x) }{ (3x-9)^{2} }$
-> $\frac{ \sec(3x)^{2}(9x - 27) - 3\tan(3x) }{ (3x-9)^{2} }$
-> $\frac{ 3(\sec(3x)^{2}(9x - 27) -\tan(3x)) }{ (3(x-3))^{2} }$
-> $\frac{ \cancel{3}(\sec(3x)^{2}(9x - 27) -\tan(3x)) }{ \cancel{9}(x-3)^{2} }$
$= \frac{ \sec(3x)^{2}(9x - 27) -\tan(3x) }{ 3(x-3)^{2} }$
or 
$= \frac{ 3\sec(3x)^{2}(3x-9) -\tan(3x) }{ 3(x-3)^{2} }$


### 4) Use the chain rule to differentiate
$y = \ln( 7x^{3} - 5x^{2}), x>0$
%% [[Chain (Outside-Inside) Rule]] %%

$u = 7x^{3} - 5x^{2}$
$u' = 21x^{2} -10x$

$v = \ln(u)$
$v' = \frac{1}{u}$

$u' \times v'$
-> $(21x^{2} - 10) \times \frac{1}{7x^{3}-5x^{2}}$
$= \frac{21x^{2} - 10}{7x^{3}-5x^{2}}$

### 5) The displacement (in metres) of a particles at time $t$ seconds is given by $s = 2000t^{2} - 30t^{4}$ for $0 \leq t \leq 90$
##### a) Find the velocity and acceleration of the particle at time $t$
$2000t^{2} - 30t^{4}$
-> $2\times2000t^{2-1} - 4\times30t^{4-1}$
-> $s' = 4000 t^{1} - 120t^{3}$

**Velocity:** $v = 4000t - 120t^{3}$

$s' = 4000t - 120t^{3}$
-> $4000t^{1-1} - 3(120)t^{3-1}$
-> $s'' = 4000 - 360t^{2}$

**Acceleration:** $a = 4000 - 360t^{2}$

##### b) What is the displacement, velocity and acceleration at time $t=1$ second?
$s = 2000t^{2} - 30t^{4}$
-> $2000(1)^{2} - 30(1)^{4}$
->$2000 - 30$
$s = 1970 \ce{m}$ at $t=1$s

$v = 4000t - 120t^{3}$
-> $v = 4000(1) - 120(1)^{3}$
$v = 3880$ $\ce{m/s^{2}}$ at $t=1$s

$a = 4000 - 360t^{2}$
-> $4000 - 360(1)^{2}$
$a = 3640$ $\ce{m/s^{2}}$ at $t=1$s
