###### Station 4 - Distribution of pigment granules in hair
Q9. (3 marks) What is the genotype, with respect to the ‘B’ and ‘D’ loci of a:
1. blue point kitten - $Bbdd/BBdd$
2. lavender point kitten - $bbdd$
3. brown point kitten  - $bbDd/bbDD$

Q10. 
a. (1 mark) What is the genotype of the blue cat at the ‘B’ and ‘D’ loci? 
$Bbdd/BBdd$
Black dilutes to blue/grey

b. (2 marks) Is this identical to any of the kittens in the litter shown? If so, at which gene locus does it differ from the kittens to give such a difference in appearance of colour distribution? 
Yes. The blue points have the same. 
They differ at the $C$ locus. The burmese would be $c^{b}c^{b}/c^{b}c^{s}$ whereas the blue points would be $c_{s}c_{s}$

**Binomial theorem activity (see pages 7-8 for details)** 
Q11. (4 marks) Use the binomial expression to calculate the chance of two heterozygous parents (Dd) generating the following combinations of kittens: 
- 5 dilute kittens in a litter of 6 kittens
- 4 dilute kittens in a litter of 6 kittens
- 3 dilute kittens in a litter of 6 kittens
- 2 dilute kittens in a litter of 6 kittens
- 1 dilute kitten in a litter of 6 kittens
