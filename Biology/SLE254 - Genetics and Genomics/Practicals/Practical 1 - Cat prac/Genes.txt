A agouti (tabbying)
a non-agouti (solid colour in non-orange)



Station 2
C (full colour) - normal enzyme
Cb (burmese dilution) - less active enzyme
Cs (siamese dilution) - temperature dependent enzyme


Station 3
B/b code for protein framework affecting density of pigment packing
B -> black granules - dense packing
b -> brown granules - less dense packing
Bb/BB -> black


Station 1
S -> white spotting - incomplete melanocyte migration
s -> no white spotting - complete migration
Ss - some white spotting
SS - extensive white spotting


Station 6
Tm -> mackerel/parallel stripes - dominant over tb/blotched
tb -> blotched stripes - present only when homozygous recessive (tb tb)

TA -> abyssinian stripes


Station 8
I -> inhibition of pigment
i -> full pigment
A black cat that is aa does not reveal it's tabby striping


Station 5
X-linked
O+ -> non-orange
Oo -> phaeomelanin pigment -> orange
O+ O+ = non-orange, colour determined by other genes
O+ Oo = tortie/tortoiseshell - occurs due to X inactivation
Oo Oo = orange

O+ Y = non-orange
Oo Y = orange


Station 9
W -> all-white
w -> non-white or not all-white
WW/Ww = white cat, dominant epistatis over all other coat colour/pattern genes


Station 4
Distribution of pigment granules in hair
D -> intense colour - uniform distribution
d -> dilute colour - uneven distribution

DD/Dd = intense / non-dilute

Non-dilute (DD/Dd)     Dilute (dd)
Black/seal          -> blue/gray
Brown/chocolate     -> lavendar/lilac
Orange/red/yellow   -> cream
