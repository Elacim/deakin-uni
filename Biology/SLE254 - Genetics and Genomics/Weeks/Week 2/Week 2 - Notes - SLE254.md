Pedigree analysis :: The following of a trait through a family

Purpose of pedigree analysis
?
- Determine trait inheritance (dominant or recessive)
- Determine if the gene is located on a sex chromosome X/Y or autosome 
- Risk of affected child

Importance of inheritance patterns :: Predicts genetic risk
What can inheritance patterns predict?
?
- Pregnancy outcomes
- Adult-onset disorders
- Recurrence risk of future offspring

- OMIM- https://www.omim.org/
	- Genetic traits are described, catalogued, and numbered in a database called
- Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)
	- OMIM is updated daily and contains information about all known human genetic traits

## Multiple alleles
**Many genes have more than two alternative alleles**
This increases the number of different genotypes and phenotypes that exist with respect to the particular gene
- Multiple alleles can only be studied in populations
- An individual diploid organism will only have, at most, two alternative forms of the same gene
- A population will show all the alternatives

###### Blood groups
 Three alternative alleles of one gene  Presence of antigens of the surface of red blood cells  Four phenotypes depending on the presence or absence of antigens

![[Week 2 - Notes - SLE254 - blood groups.png]]Alleles code for presence or absence of cell marker molecules on the erythrocyte surface
Antibodies in the serum which can identify and destroy Antigens on the surface of another blood group

###### Bombay Phenotype
 The Bombay Phenotype was first reported in 1952 in Bombay, India.  Bombay cells can’t be converted to group A or B  Mutation in the FUT1 gene prevents synthesis of H substance, vital for producing functional A and B antigens 

So individual may have I^A and/or I^B alleles, but neither antigen is added to the cell surface and they are functionally type O

Bombay phenotype H antigen is not expressed on RBCs.
Serum contains anti-H termed as 'OH' blood group.
First discovered in Mumbai by Dr.Y.M. Bhende.
- Present in about 4 per million of human population
- More common in India — 180 cases reported in india
	- *Individuals considered as universal donor of blood. Can only receive blood from another person with the bombay phenotype*


# Definition of traits
**Polygenic traits**
- Traits controlled by two or more genes
- Patterns of inheritance that can be measured quantitatively
- Example: human eye colour

**Multifactorial traits**
- Polygenic traits resulting from interactions of two or more genes and one or more environmental factors
- Example: skin colour

 Skin colour is controlled by 3 or 4 genes and environmental factors  We’re all born with a skin colour based on our genes but the environment can alter this


**Complex traits**
- Traits controlled by multiple genes and the interaction of environmental factors where the contributions of genes and environment are undefined
- Example: hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular disease, depression, autism

Many human diseases are controlled by the action of several genes.
