• Frank Fletcher, 22 years old, electrician • Noticed his vision was blurred and colours seemed paler than usual • Perfect vision until that time • Optician noticed that Frank’s retina was showing signs of change

 Disk swelling in the retina (papilloedema)  Retinal blood vessels abnormal


• His central vision became progressively worse over the next few months and he had to give up work • His mother’s vision was fine but her brother (his uncle) had been blind since he was 28 • His mother’s sister (his aunt), Doreen, has serious visual defects since age 45 but with a slower progression than Frank • Doreen was also found to have some heart rhythm problems

• Because of the family history, Frank attended a genetics clinic • Diagnosed with Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) • Key points that lead to the diagnosis: • The nature of the eye problem • The rapid progression in affected males • Later onset and milder symptoms in females • Heart rhythm problems in Doreen • Frank was shocked by the diagnosis, but was particularly concerned about whether he would pass on the condition

**[[Maternal inheritance]]**
 Vertical transmission pattern  Children of affected men are never affected  All children of affected women will be affected, but the degree of severity is extremely variable
