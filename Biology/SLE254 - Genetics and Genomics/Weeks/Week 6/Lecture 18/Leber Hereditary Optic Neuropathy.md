 First described in 1871 by the German ophthalmologist Theodore Leber
- 1 in 30,000 - 50,000, predominantly males affected
- 2% of people on the blind register in Australia
- Bilateral subacute loss of central vision
- Focal degeneration of the retinal ganglion cell layer and optic nerve
- Mitochondrial genetic disease

• LHON affects large number of French-Canadians in Quebec
- Example of a founder effect
- 1663, there was an unfavourable ratio of six male colonists to every European-born female
- King Louis XIV sent over 700 young single French women (“filles du roy,” or “King’s daughters”) between 1663 and 1673
- Many of the 5 million French-Canadians living in Quebec province are descendants of these women
- One woman carried a single nucleotide change in her mtDNA
- Marrying one of the colonists in Quebec City in 1669, she produced five daughters who also all married in or near Quebec City
- Today, as many as 90% of French-Canadians affected with LHON can trace their ancestry back to this woman
