[Meiosis:independent assortment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zzp3mLIycM)


###### Answer these revision questions
- [ ] What is the different between chromatin and chromatids and at what stages in the cell cycle do they exist?

- [ ] At what stage of meiosis does crossing over and independent assortment occur? Do these events occur in mitosis, why?

- [ ] How many chromosomes are present at each cell cycle stage?

- [ ] How many chromatids?

- [ ] How many copies of the same gene (somatic cells chromosomes only)? (i.e how many molecules of DNA?)

- [ ] What are the two main sources of genetic variation produced by meiosis?


###### 
## Gene inheritance & transmission

#### Topic learning objectives

By the end of this topic you should be able to:
- [ ] Explain what P1, F1, and F2 generations are.
- [ ] List Mendel's postulates (rules) of inheritance & define the law of independent assortment.
- [ ] Define genotype and phenotype.
- [ ] Use a Punnett square to determine the results of a monohybrid cross.
- [ ] Apply the product and sum laws to calculate the probability of an event.
- [ ] Explain when binomial expansion can be used.
- [ ] Use the binomial theorem to calculate the probability of certain events.
- [ ] Use the chi square test to test a hypothesis regarding observed and expected Mendelian ratios
