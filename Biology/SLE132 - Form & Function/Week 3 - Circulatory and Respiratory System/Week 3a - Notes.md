#flashcards/weeks-132/week-3/a
Why is the circulatory system needed? :: 
What problem caused the circulatory system to arise? :: The need to diffuse resources and waste between cells and the environment

How far can oxygen diffuse in most animal tissues? :: Roughly 0.5mm (radius)
How does low oxygen diffusion radius affect organisms? :: It makes cells limited in size and therefore organisms

What are the functions of the circulatory system?
?
- Transportation of Oxygen and $CO_{2}$
- Nutrients
- Wastes (ammonia, metabolic wastes like lactic acid)
- For the purpose of homeostasis
- Hormone transportation
- Immune defence


What is an alternative to a circulatory system? :: A dense, branched gastrovascular cavity
How do organisms with gastrovascular cavities diffuse? :: Either directly through their epidermis or through the gastrovascular vacity
What organisms have only a gastrovascular cavity? :: Cnidarians and flatworms

What does a circulatory system require? :: A heart or other pump-like organ

##### Open circulatory system
Open circulatory system? :: A collection of tubes pumped with haemolymph then out into organism structures
Haemolymph? :: 'blood' and other fluids. Haemolymph resources -> cells directly, no arteries
Ex? :: [[Arthropoda (Insects, Spiders, Crustaceans)]] and most [[Mollusca (Gastropods, Bivalves, and Cephalopods)]] (not snails)
What happens when the heart relaxes in open circulatory systems? :: The haemolymph returns and valves within the heart prevent backflow

**Short summary - Slide 9a**
**Open**
• Haemolymph
• Large volume circulated
(crayfish 25% Of body weight, gastropods 90%)
• Low pressure system (crayfish 13/1 mmHg)
• Low Circulation velocity (crayfish 8 minutes)
•Limited ability to regulate flow to different parts
of the body
##### Closed circulatory system
**Short summary - Slide 9a**
• Blood
• Small volume circulated
(mammals 7 — 10% Of body fluid)
• High blood pressure (Humans, 125/75 mmHg)
• High circulation velocity (Humans 21 seconds)
• Can control supply of blood to different parts of
the body (e.g. In exercise blood to muscles, away
from gut)

Closed circulatory system? :: Closed tubes (vessels) with blood
How does blood reach organism structures? :: Blood/fluids -> vessels -> cells
Do worms have 5 hearts? :: Technically yes, they have a main heart and 4 other auxiliary hearts

How does blood flow in a fish? :: In a single loop
What chambers does a fish have? :: Two main chambers, the ventricle and atrium
Where is blood enriched with oxygen in a fish? :: Within the gills
Issues with a single loop system :: A large drop in pressure occurs in gill capillaries meaning there is slow delivery which limits organism activity
What does a single loop circulatory system entail? :: Deoxygenated blood is pumped, taken to the gills, goes to the organs, then back to the heart

What is a double circulatory system? :: A circulatory system with pressure from the left and right side
Left side? :: Pumps oxygenated blood
Right side? :: Pumps deoxygenated blood

Amphibians and reptiles (excluding crocodiles which have four) have a three chambered heart - two atrium and 1 ventricle
	Partial separation
Pulmocutaneous circuit - frogs can breathe through skin and lungs


What organisms have two atrium and two ventricles? :: Birds, mammals, and crocofiles
Complete double circulation - no deoxygenated/oxygenated mixing
Best for - higher blood pressure, flow rates, delivery of blood, and the ability to support most active animals with higher metabolic rates


Systemic circulation meaning :: The blood supply to organs and tissues

##### 3 types of blood vessels
Veins carry blood ...... the heart :: to the heart
Name for veins in organs :: Venules
Arteries carry blood ...... the heart :: from/away the heart
Name for arteries in organs :: Arterioles
Capillaries? :: Small blood vessels for gas exchange, form capillary beds

Veins :: Thin walls, less muscle tissue and elastic fibres
- large lumen
- valves preventing backflow
- low pressure return

Arteries :: Thick walls with muscle tissue, elastic fibres
Size of the lumen in arteries :: Small
How is high pressure achieved in arteries? :: The small lumen size
- Small lumen (allowing high pressure)
- No valves
- High pressure (due to lumen size)

Arteries/vein composition :: The hole, or lumen, and 3 layers - simple squamous epithelium, smooth muscle, and connective tissue
Difference between capillaries and arteries/veins :: Capillaries only have one layer of cells, the simple squamous epithelium

Body-wide capillary blood content at any one time :: Around 5-10% of capillaries have blood in them at any one time
What force is behind capillary-environment resource movement? :: 

How are capillary beds regulated? :: Dilation/constriction and sphincters located before the capillary
Dilation and constriction :: Arteriole smooth muscle is contracted and dilated to allow and prevent blood flow
What is a sphincter? :: A muscly valve ring
Thoroughfare channel? :: A channel where blood can flow through and if surrounding sphincters are contracted, bypass the capillary bed completely
What part of a capillary bed is contracted during strenuous exercise? :: The pre-capillary sphincters, redirecting blood through to the thoroughfare channel

#### The heart
Atria? :: Collect the blood with it's thin walls, exclusively pumps to ventricles
Ventricles? :: Thick and muscular walls, strong contractions compared to atria
Which ventricle is thickest? :: The left ventricle as it pumps the blood out 
Left ventricle is significantly thicker than the right

Atriovencular is equivalent to :: Tri/bicuspid, which refers to valve attachment

Blood flow overview - Slide 15a:
1. Right ventricle w/ deoxygenated blood to the lungs
2. Goes through the pulmonary arteries
3. Capillary beds exchange $CO_{2}$ for $O_{2}$
4. Oxygenated blood flows back into the heart through the left atrium
5. The left ventricle pumps out the oxygenated blood to tissues

9. Deoxygenated blood from head, neck and forelimbs travels to the superior vena cava
10. Deoxyegenated blood from trunk/hind limbs -> Inferior vena cava 
11. Superior and inferior vena cava lead into right atrium and empty blood
12. Repeat.

###### Heartbeat - Slide 15b
Name for contraction :: Systole
Name for relaxation :: Diastole
What is a rough average for the cardiac duration? :: 0.8 seconds, or 75bpm

Diastole? :: Filling with blood due to low pressure; half the time (~0.4 seconds)
Atrial systole? :: Ventricles are still relaxed and filling; atria forces are contracted; ~0.1 seconds
Ventriular systole? :: Blood is ejected out down to up (the audible heartbeat); atrioventricular valves are closed as a result of ventricle contraction; semilunar valves are open; ~0.3 seconds

What muscles, aside from cardiac, assist with delivering blood? :: Skeletal muscles and breathing muscles

**Blood pressure**
Capillaries affecting pressure :: Capillaries are small and as they only let one RBC through, pressure stays higher
What is blood pressure? :: The force of blood on blood vessels
Determined? Cardiac output and resistance to blood flow
- Highest in aorta
- Declines slightly in arteries, significantly in arterioles
- Stead by slow flow in capillaries due to resistance
- Veins have very low pressure

Rough human range for humans :: 125/75mmHg
Systolic pressure ::: Name for pressure that is between 110-140mmHg
Diastolic pressure ::: Name for pressure that is between 70-90mmHg
What does systolic pressure sound like? :: Like flowing liquid
What does diastolic pressure sound like? :: There is no sound
What devices are used for measuring blood pressure? :: Sphygmomanometer and stethoscope
Blood vessels in your body :: 90,000km
Blood/day :: 7,500L per day circulates, done with about 5-6L total in the body

Angioplasty :: Expanding blood vessel with tiny balloon and sometimes a stent
Angiogram :: Lookin' at blood vessels, xray

**Capillary exchange**
What is exchanged to and from capillaries? :: Resources like oxygen, $CO_{2}$, and glucose
What is a requirement for oxygen/$CO_{2}$ diffusion? :: They need to be dissolved in water
Where can molecules diffuse? :: Through and between epithelial cells
Proteins - stay in blood

| Molecule | Blood | Tissue |
| -------- | ----- | ------ |
| Oxygen   | high  | low    |
| CO2      | low   | high   |
| Glucose  | high  | low    |
|          |       |        |

Does all fluid stay in capillaries? :: No, there is a ~1% flow out them
What stops tissues from swelling? :: The lymphatic system
What is the purpose of the lymphatic system? :: To return fluids to the circulatory system leaked out capillaries
Lymph capillaries??

If going from the right ventricle to the right atrium, at a minimum, how many capillary beds would a red blood cell go through? :: Two. Right ventricle -> pulmonary artery -> pulmonary capillary bed -> left ventricle -> capillary bed-> organs -> inferior vena cava -> right atrium

**Blood components**
Human body rough litres of blood :: 4-6 litres
Plasma percent :: 55%
Plasma contents :: Water, salts, wastes, nutrients, hormones, proteins etc.

What components do most cells in the mammalian body contain that RBCs don't? :: Nuclei or mitochondria
**SLIDE 26b**

Neutrophil purpose :: The defence against bacteria
Lymphocyte purpose :: Immune system help
Monocyte purpose :: AKA macrophages, they engulf bacteria
Eosinophil purpose :: Allergy causer and parasite preventor
Basophil purpose :: First-responder to injuries, can contain anti-clotting and histamines for blood vessel dilation
What is the purpose of swelling? :: increase WBC count
Platelet purpose? :: Cell fragments for clotting blood (prevents bleeding out)

**Blood clotting**
First, platelets clot and stopping the bleeding for small wounds and the same but temporarily for bigger wounds
Second, fibrin clots (fribrinogen -> firbrin) that traps blood, and seal the vessel

Ulcerations, possibly acids, bacteria, haemorrighinic  viuses


How can you figure out the amount of blood going through a person? :: Volume (~75mL) $\times$ heart rate. e.g. 75mL $\times$ 70bpm = 5.25L/min

Cardiac output alterations:
activity levels (strenuous exercise can lead to a 5 fold increase)
hormones e.g. adrenalin
other chemicals e.g. caffeine
drugs e.g. beta-blockers

**Heartbeat Regulation**
Pacemaker cells purpose :: They keep the heartbeat in time and at regular intervals
Nervous messages :: from the brain, two sets of nerves (increase/decrease speed); used for example in exercise ("increase heart rate cause we're exercising")
- hormones
Two parts of the heart: Sinoatrial (SA) node - specialised region of cardiac muscle with pacemaker cells that establishes heart beat rate
Atrioventricular (AV) node - ventricular contraction

What is the sequence of a heartbeat?
?
1. Electrical signals are generated by pacemaker cells
2. Atria contract from signals
3. Atrioventricular node contracts 0.1 seconds after signal
4. Signal is carried to ventricle cardiac muscles by specialised muscle fibres
5. Ventricles contract
