What affects the haemoglobin oxygen saturation? :: The partial pressure of oxygen
What is the purpose of respiration? :: Oxygen for cellular respiration and for removal of $CO_{2}$ coming from respiration

3 main process :: Gas exchange with environment, distribution of gases throughout the organism, and diffusion of gases

Oxygen sources :: Air (21% $O_{2}$) or water (varying, about $40\times$ lower concentration than air )
What is mandatory for gases before diffusion across cell membranes? :: It must be dissolved in water (e.g. $O_{2(l)} \xrightarrow{water} O_{2(aq)}$)

Characteristics of respiratory membranes :: Thin, well-ventilated, moist, and a high SA:V ratio
Challenges with maintaining respiratory membranes :: Keeping them moist and there must be structure keeping it spread out (preventing folding) 

Out-folding respiratory structures :: Skin and gills
In-folding :: Tracheae and lungs

Breathing through the skin name :: Cutaneous breathing
What type of breathing do earthworms do? :: Skin breathing (cutaneous breathing)
What are some major limitations of cutaneous breathing? :: The body must be moist, and only small/thing/long/flat animals can sustain it - bigger size means exponentially increasing diffusion time
Are cutaneous breathers limited to their skin for breathing? :: No, there can be a circulatory system (such as with earthworms)

Gills :: Out-folding organs evolved to have thin walls and a large surface area for optimal gas exchange
What are the characteristics of most Annelida gills (like marine worms)? :: The gills are found on their leg-like appendages (parapodia) 
What are the characteristics of some crustacean gills (like lobsters)? :: The lobster gills are long and feather-like; they are covered by the exoskeleton  
What are the characteristics of starfish gills? :: The gills are all over the body, like a segmented skin 
What appendage functions for walking, swimming, and as gills? :: Polychaete legs - parapodia


**Counter-current exchange (fish gills)**
What is counter-current exchange? ::: In $O_{2}$/$CO_{2}$ diffusion in fish, the blood is going one direction while water is going the other
How is counter-current exchange formed/maintained? :: The fish mouth constantly takes in water where it is pumped then allowed to flow over the gills in one direction
What is the primary benefit of counter-current exchange? :: From counter-current exchange, there should never be a $O_{2}:\text{oxygenated blood}$ equilibrium. This enables the fish to take $O_{2}$ from the flowing water and diffuse it with ease into the blood.
What is the result of a fish not having counter-current exchange? :: It would have less ability to utilise oxygen for body functions, notably disallowing it to move rapidly
It allows much more $O_{2}$ transfer - the concentrations are always different, whereas if they were parallel, an equilibrium would form and not as much $O_{2}$ would be transferred

**Gill structure**
Components of gills :: Gill filaments, the gill arch, capillary beds, and lamellae
In gills, what is a lamella? :: Sequenced rounded housing for capillary beds; all attached to each other by parallel tubular lamellae

**Air breathing**
Advantage(s) of breathing in air :: $21\% O_{2} > ~1\%$ in $H_{2}O$, and that the energy spent breathing air is lower as it is lighter than water
Disadvantage(s) of breathing air :: Dehydration
Problems with gills in air :: They collapse, sticking together, significant water loss, and they are not optimised for air-breathing
Benefit(s) of an infolding surface for breathing :: Allows air breathing to be viable without as much dehydration
**Tracheal**
What organisms is the tracheal system found in? :: Insects
What is the insect tracheal system? :: Air tubes all throughout body
What are the benefits of the insect tracheal system? :: The air is directly taken to cells connected to tracheoles
Alternative name for insect *respiratory* system :: The alternative to insect *tracheal* system
What are the structures of the insect respiratory/tracheal system? :: Trachea(e), air sacs, spiracles, tracheoles
What are tracheae? :: Large chitinous tubes connecting to spiracles which lead to the outside environment
What are tracheoles? :: Small chitinous tubes that deliver air to cells
What are spiracles? :: Pores that open to the exterior environment
What are air sacs? :: Expanded out tracheae formed into sacs that hold air

**Slide 11b-12a** for details

**Lungs**
What are lungs? :: Internally located moist sacs 
What is the benefit of lungs being found internally? :: It significantly reduces water loss
Where are lungs found and why? :: At one location for optimising air intake 
What is the disadvantage of lungs being singly located? :: The body requires a circulatory system to transport air
Aside from mammals, what other species have lungs independently evolved from? :: Spiders, land-based slugs/snails, and vertebrates

What are air tubes lined with? :: Mucus secreting, ciliated epithelium
What are alveoli and their basic structure? :: Moist squamous epithelium lined sacs
What is the surface area of a single human lung? :: $80m^{2}$
Roughly how many alveoli are in a single human lung? :: 300 million alveoli/lung

Name for the lungs of a spider :: Booklung
Name for the lungs of birds :: Long tubes

What is the single opening that mammals have for breathing? :: The trachea
Normal breath volume in humans :: $0.5L$
Maximum lung inhalation/exhalation capacity in humans :: $3.5...4.8L$ 
What does 'vital capacity' mean in reference to the respiratory system? :: The maximum lung inhalation and exhalation volume
What does 'tidal volume' mean in reference to the respiratory system? :: The regular amount of air inhaled/exhaled per regular breath 

Do our lungs completely lose air? :: They don't - think of it like an uninflated balloon - it's hard to get them kickstarted if they lose all air

What is the process of inhalation in negative pressure ventilation? :: Ribs muscles and diaphragm contract, increasing pressure -> chest cavity increases in volume -> lungs expand and suck in air

What is the process of exhalation in negative pressure ventilation? :: Ribs muscles and diaphragm relax, decreasing pressure -> chest cavity decreases in volume -> lungs increase in pressure and force air out
Why does air feel forced to leave us? :: Pressure build-up

Frogs ventilation type :: Positive pressure ventilation
Lungs? :: Simple vascular sacs, no branching, folding. Also, cutaneous breathing
How? :: Mouth muscles go down, forcing air inside. Mouth + nostril are closed, then mouth muscles go back up, forcing air into lungs
Mouth name in frogs :: Buccal cavity
Exhalation? :: Lungs recoil elastically and force the air out the lungs; body wall compresses

Haem :: A red iron compound found in haemoglobin
Haemoglobin

Gaseous exchange.mp4


What does haemoglobin do to blood capacity? :: In greatly increases the oxygen holding capacity
Blood + haem pigment ~= 20mL $O_{2}$/100mL of blood
Blood w/o haem ~= 0.2mL of $O_{2}$/100mL

$Hb + O_{2} \leftrightarrow HbO_{2}$
Oxygen high -> binds to haemoglobin
Low -> unbinds and diffuses out

What makes haemoglobin go blue? :: The lack of oxygen

What is the haemoglobin equivalent found in invertebrates? :: Haemocyanin
What is a unique characterisitic of haemocyanin compared to haemoglobin? :: Cyanin uses copper instead of iron, turning blood blue
Haemocyanin location :: Haemolymph
