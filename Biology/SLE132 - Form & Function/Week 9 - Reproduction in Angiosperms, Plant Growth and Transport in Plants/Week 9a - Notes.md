**Learning outcomes**
Male and female gametophytes develop within anthers and ovaries, respectively.
Pollination brings male and female gametophytes together.
Self-incompatibility prevents self-pollen from fertilising eggs of the same plant and
is regulated by the S gene.
Flowering plants have 'double fertilisation'.
Animals have played a role in angiosperm evolution.
The ovule develops into a seed, containing an embryo and a supply of nutrients.
The ovary develops into a fruit adapted for seed dispersal.
Evolutionary adaptations of seed germination.
Asexual reproduction produces plant clones.
Sexual and asexual reproduction are complementary in the life histories of some
plants.

# Class
Attract pollinators using visual cues/chemicals
Many angiosperms reproduce both sexually and asexually
Pollinators carry pollen from anthers (male) -> carpel (female gametophyte)
Life cycle: Flowers, double fertilisation, and fruits (3 Fs)
Often symbiotic with other species

[[Angiosperm reproduction]]
![[Angiosperm life cycle.png]]
The gametophyte is only the pollen grains/embryo sac

[[Flowers]]

Anthers produce pollen

[[Seeds]]

[[Pollination]]

[[Double fertilisation]]

SLIDES 7a AND 7b
Endosperm development usually predates embryo development



Below the cotyledons is the hypocotyl (embyronic axis) that terminates in the radicle (embryonic root)
