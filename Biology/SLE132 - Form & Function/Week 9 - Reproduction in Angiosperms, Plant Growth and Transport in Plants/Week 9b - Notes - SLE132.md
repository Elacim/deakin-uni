Transpiration :: Water movement throughout a plant and evaporation from leaves/roots/flowers
Adhesion - sticking to cell wall
Cohesion - water sticking to itself

Roots to veins - xylem

#### Water transport
[Water transport video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CMrK8rlzZw)
Transpiration mainly occurs within leaves
Where can transpiration occur? :: The cuticle, lenticels, and stomata
Lenticels :: Spongy regions in bark, not much water lost
Stomata? :: Primary water loss

Open stoma has turgid guard cells
Closed stoma (LMs) is flaccid
	Water goes into adjacent cells (like potassium)

The radial orientation of the microfibrils allow for increase in length rather than width as they are resistant to stretching and compression in the directional parallel to the microfibrils.

Stomata microfibrils are radially oriented, allowing length-wise stretching and a resistance to parallel stretching and compression

Transpiration steps :: Evaporation and diffusion (SLIDE 11b)

Stoma per leaf of tobacco :: 1200/stomata/cm$^{3}$
Stoma abundance :: 1% of leaf surface area

Guard cells close from $K^{+}$ ions being transported across the vacuole membrane (**tonoplast**) and the guard cell membranes (**plasmalemma**) into adjacent cells
	SLIDE 13a-13b


[[Transpiration]]
	Increase in $CO_{2}$: stomata close, decrease: open
	Increase in light: stomata open, decrease close
	Temperature: 10-25C: little effect, high temps: stomata cloes
		low temps?
	Low water (water stress/high transpiration): stomata close 
	CAM plants open stomata
	Hormones (Abscisic acid (ABA)) increase = close
	Biological clock

Rate of transpiration is directly affected by closing/opening of stomata
	Transpiration doubles every 10C rise
		Evaporation cools surface
			So leaf may be ~5C vs ambient being 10C
	Humidity
		High/increase
			Less water loss
	Air
		More wind = less water around leaf = less transpiration (humidity-dependent)

Water + dissolved substances diffuse into roots -> xylem vessels via endodermis
Roots have large SA:V
	10,000km roots, many root hairs

Slide 16b
apoplastic - via cell walls
symplastic - through cytoplasm to protoplast
transcellular - cell to cell (vacuole to vacuole) - least common

Slide 19a
Casparian strip (water impervious due to fatty surface)
	Controls flow rate
	Occurs in cells perpendicular

Root pressure can help for small plants, not for big (Slide 17a)
	Root pressure is low
	Many plants have no root pressure (like conifers)
	Transpiration occurs in cut stems, meaning it must be pulled from the top

Water pull
	Air has less water than leaf tissue (water from leaf -> air)
	Cohesion-adhesion theory
		Water is cohesive (lagging molecules will follow leading)
		Water adheres to xylem walls, counteracting gravity	
	Water potential 

Phloem - sieve tubes members laid out end-to-end
Phloem sap :: Sugary solution that can move freely between cells (Inorganic ions, amino acids, hormones, sucrose)

[[Sugar sources and sinks]]

### Sap movement
Why does sap move? :: Pressure flow mechanism
Sugar source -> phloem by active transport
	Solute concentration increases
Water enters phloem osmotically (increase in water pressure at sugar source)

SLIDE 21a

#### Phloem loading (21b-22b)
Can be
	apoplastic
		sucrose from mesophyll cells -> sieve tube/companion cell complex via plasmodesmata
	symplastic
		sucrose enters apoplast (cell wall) -> active load into sieve tube/companion cell complex
