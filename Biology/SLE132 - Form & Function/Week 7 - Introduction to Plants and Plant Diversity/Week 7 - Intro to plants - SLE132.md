Why study them?
- They can be used to make plastics, clothing, resins, and rubber
- They can be used as medicines (anti-cancer, vaccines, anti-malaria (quinine), drugs)

Roughly how many living plant species are there? :: ~290,000
Roughly how many non-vascular plant species are there? :: ~24,000
Roughly how many vascular plant species are there? :: ~250,000 (?including? gymnosperms)

Plants are found everywhere

What did land plants evolve from? :: Charophytes, a type of green algae
Why are Charophytes considered the closest living relative of land plants? :: They have close features in their nucleus and chloroplast genes


This unit uses the **Embryophyte** definition of the Plant kingdom
	Plants nurture the embryo sporophyte within parent gametophyte tissues
		Algae do not

### 5 key traits in nearly all land plants
?
1. Apical meristems
2. Alternation of generations
3. Walled spores produced in sporangia
4. Multicellular gametangia (a gamete producing organ)
5. Dependent embryos

#### Apical meristem
Found? :: Roots and shoots
Shoots - apical meristems without prongs
	Leaf primordia
Growth? :: Continuous regeneration/division
Purpose? :: Can differentiate into other tissues; geometry allows increased environmental exposure

#### Alternation of generations
##### [[SLE111 - Week 6 - Notes#Non-vascular plants - slide 8|Plants]]
Slide 6b and 7a
Plants and some species of algae exhibit a second type of life cycle called alternation of generations (Figure 13.6b ). This type includes both diploid and haploid stages that are multicellular. The multicellular diploid stage is called the sporophyte. Meiosis in the sporophyte produces haploid cells called spores. Unlike a gamete, a haploid spore doesnâ€™t fuse with another cell but divides mitotically, generating a multicellular haploid stage called the gametophyte. Cells of the gametophyte give rise to gametes by mitosis. Fusion of two haploid gametes at fertilisation results in a diploid zygote, which develops into the next sporophyte generation. Therefore, in this type of life cycle, the sporophyte generation produces a gametophyte as its offspring, and the gametophyte generation produces a sporophyte. The name alternation of generations fits well for this type of life cycle.

Meiosis produces daughter cells with genetically ... makeup :: Distinct. Mitosis produces identical.
How are 4 daughter cells produced from one germ cell (using humans as an example)? :: The DNA is duplicated before Meiosis I, meaning there are `46*2=92` chromosomes. Each daughter cell (gamete) is haploid (1n) compared to somatic cells being diploid (2n). These gametes therefore receive half as much DNA - therefore, `92/4=23` chromosomes per cell

Is saying male (antheridia) and female (archegonia) plant sex organs are attached to the gametophyte similar to saying the ovaries and testes are attached to our body?

Phenotype/genotype stuff




#### Spore production
What are spores produced in? :: The sporangia
Diploid cells (sporocytes) produce haploid spores through meiosis (which is reductive)
What is the major polymer that the walls of spores are comprised of? :: Sporopollenin
What does sporopollenin do for spores? :: It resists harsh conditions (desiccation, boiling)

#### Multicellular gametangia
What is the function of the gametangia? :: It produces gametes via mitosis
Name for female gametangia :: Archegonia
Name for male gametangia :: Antheridia
What does the archegonia do? :: It produces eggs and is the site of fertilisation
What does the antheridia do? :: It is the site of sperm production and release

#### Dependent embryo
Where is the embryo stored? :: The tissue of female gametophyte
How are nutrients transferred from the parent to the embryo? :: Diffusion through placental transfer cells

embryophte name reason? :: Dependency of embryo on parent


### Origin/diversification
Slide 10b

Plants can most simply be grouped based on what? :: The presence of absence of vascular tissue
Common name for non-vascular plants? :: Bryophytes


[[Binomial nomenclature]]
Are She-Oaks oaks? :: No, they belong to *Allocasuarina* genus and not the oak genus *Quercus*

[[Bryophytes]]
[[Seedless vascular plants]]
[[#Spore production]]

Pollination - like fertilisation but with pollen to ovules.
Pollen contains multiple sperm

[[Gymnosperms]]

[[Angiosperms (Anthophyta)]]
