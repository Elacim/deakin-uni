## Photosynthesis - 8a, slide 16a onwards
What is photosynthesis? :: The conversion of solar energy into chemical energy
All energy comes from what source? :: The sun
Where does photosynthesis occur? :: On the thylakoid membranes and stroma of chloroplasts
True or false: Nearly all plants are heterotrophs :: False, they are all nearly autotrophs

Chloroplast origin? :: Similar to photosynthetic bacteria
Major sites of photosynthesis? :: Leaves
Leaves are organs
Leaves are green as they reflect green light best'
	Chlorophyll - green pigment
Stomatas - CO2 eneters, O2 exits, H2O lost too

$\ce{6CO2 + 12H2O + \text{light energy} -> C6H12O6 + 6O2 H2O}$

Light is used to make ATP and NADPH
Calvin cycle
SLIDE 19a

#### Pigments
Chlorophyll pigment colour(s) :: Green
	Different pigments on slide 21a (not assessable)
Carotenoids pigment colour(s) :: Red, yellow, and orange
Phycobilins pigment colour(s) :: Red and blue

Main photosynthetic pigment :: Chlorophyll $a$
What do accessory pigments do? :: Broaden the spectrum of light for use in photosynthesis

Pigments have double bonds - $e^{-}$ can be excited meaning it is in a higher energy state
	When going back to a stable state, photons come off and the pigment fluoresces and releases heat
