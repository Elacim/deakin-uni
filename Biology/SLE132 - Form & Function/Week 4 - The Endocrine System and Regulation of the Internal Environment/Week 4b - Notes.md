What is the nitrogenous waste? :: Ammonia ($NH_{3}$)
Where does ammonia come from? :: It comes from $-NH_{3}$ groups attached to proteins and amino acids which are broken down and ammonia released
AMMONIA DANGERS - Slide 13a

Ammonia can not be stored (though it is highly soluble in water) and must be rid of
	Done whenever necessary in aquatic organisms

Urea - mammals/adult amphibians
- allows storage
- requires water for excretion

Uric acid - birds/reptiles/insects
- allows storage
- complex and more energy needed to produce
- insoluble and no-little water
Why do birds use uric acid instead of urea? :: More water leads to more weight so using uric acid which requires no water means less weight for take-off

What system in the body is similar to the excretion? :: Osmoregulation
Most excretory systems are a series of :: Tubes (tubular)

##### Universal characteristics in mammals
SLIDE 8b
What processes in the kidney are universal in mammals? :: Filtration, re-absorption, secretion, and excretion

What does filtration involve? :: Pressurised blood forcing filtrate from glomerulus capillaries into Bowman's capsule
What does reabsorption involve? :: 
What does secretion involve? :: 
What does excretion involve? :: 


##### Process
###### Glomerulus
Purpose? :: Filtration of blood
Name for liquid inside glomerulus (post blood movement) :: Filtrate

###### Loop of Henle
Proximal tubules and loop of Henle
Active reabsorption of nutrients, $Cl^{-}$ and $Na^{+}$ ions
Passive reabsorption of water, $K^{+}$, and $HCO_{3}^{-}$
Secretion of $H^{+}$ and $NH_{3}$

The descending part of the loop of Henle is permeable to .... but not ... :: to water but not salts
The ascending part of the loop of Henle is permeable to .... but not ... :: to salts but not water



Which part of the nephron is hyperosmotic compared to the tubules? :: The medulla
Is $NaCl$ moved out passively or actively in the loop of Henle? :: Passively first, then actively 
As the filtrate moves along the loop of Henle, how is the concentration affected? :: It starts low, then as $H_{2}O$ is diffused out, the concentration goes up before being passively then actively diffused out

**Distal tubule**
Reabsorptions :: Further reabsorption of water, $Na^{+}$, $Cl^{-}$, and $HCO_{3}^{-}$ 
Secretions :: $H^{+}$, $K^{+}$, drugs, and poisons

Collecting duct:
SLIDE 7b


What effect would of a longer loop of Henle have on urine? :: The urine would become more concentration due to increased absorption of water



# Hormones & Endocrine
What are hormones important for? :: Homeostasis and for controlling body-wide events
What may body-wide events be? :: Growth, maturation, reproduction, and metabolic rate
How are hormones transported? :: Through blood or haemolymph
Will hormones target any and every cell they find? :: No, only cells with receptors
What produces hormones? :: Endocrine glands and misc organs like the liver or digestive tract
What is triggered when a hormone attaches to a target receptor? :: It initiates a signal transduction pathway

![[Week 4b - Excretory System and Hormones.pdf#page=11]]
Endocrine signalling? :: 
Paracrine signalling? :: 
Autocrine signalling? :: 
Synaptic signalling? :: 
Neuroendocrine signalling? :: 

Steroid hormone receptor location :: In the cytoplasm
Non-steroid hormone receptor location :: Hormones
Requirements? :: Correct signal transduction pathways within cell

Prolactin :: Milk synthesis in mammals, frog metamorphosis delay, salt/water balance regulation in fish
Is one type of hormone (e.g.) responsible for one job in the an organism? :: No, it can do multiple things depending on the tissue, pathways, or receptors

**Adrenaline**
Constrictions? :: Intestine capillaries
Dilations? :: Muscle capillaries
Glycogen breakdown in liver for glucose release
Result? :: Coordinated, whole body response


**Steroid hormones**
![[Steroid hormone diagram.png|200]]
What are steroid hormones? :: Lipids that are synthesised from cholesterol
What do they always affect? :: Gene expression and alter protein production

Hormon receptor location :: In the cell, often in the nucleus
Producers of steroid hormones (in humans) :: Ovaries, testes, and adrenal cortex

**Non-steroid hormones**
![[Non-steroid hormone diagram.png]]
Most common hormones? :: Non-steroid hormones
Non-steroid components? :: Amino acids
Action on meeting cell membrane? :: Bind to membrane, don't enter
Main purpose? :: To modify protein action


**Endocrine glands**
Purpose? :: Secrete hormones
Where are hormones secreted to? :: Directly into blood (no ducts)
Long distance regulators
Interact with nervous system
Neurosecretory cells - specialised nerve cells that secrete hormones into blood from nerve signal

![[Endocrine-CNS-neuroendocrine-nervous system.png]]

Most organs can produce hormones
- Digestive system (8 hormones - gastrin)
- Liver (insulin-like -growth factors)
- Heart (reduce blood pressure)
