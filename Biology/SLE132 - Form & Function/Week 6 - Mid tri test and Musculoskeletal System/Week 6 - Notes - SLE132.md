(there is no 6a due to mid-tri test, only 6b)

What is the purpose of movement? :: To obtain food, escape danger, and to reproduce

Types of movement:
	Running
	Walking
	Hopping
	Crawling
	Flying
	Slithering
	Swimming
	Gliding (using something like slime)
Different movements have different efficiencies

Are lighter animals more energy efficient than heavy animals? :: No, heavy animals are due to better structures, metabolism being proportional to body mass, and momentum

Graph on 2b
Which mode of transport is most energy intensive? :: Flying
Second most? :: Running
Least? :: Swimming

Getting going is the most energy intensive thing

**Swimming**

Advantages:
No gravity
Not much 

Disadvantages:


**Running/walking**
Advantages: 
	Fast
	Very mobile (easy turning too)
	Energy-efficient at high body masses
	Relatively stable and safe
	Friction is minimal on the small surface area of feets

Disadvantages:
	Not efficient in small animals
	Requires lots of energy to maintain running speed
	Lots of specialised muscles needed
	If a limb is cut off, you're a bit boned
	Body weight has to be held up

**Flying**
Advantages: 
	High speed
	Novel food sources
	Less restrictions
	Escape from predators

Disadvantages:
	Have to overcome air drag and gravity


**Locomotion**
What are the two key (general) structures needed for locomotion? :: Muscle to generate force and a skeleton to provide leverage
How does a skeleton assist locomotion? :: Leverage
How do muscles assist locomotion? :: They generate force

Purpose of skeletons :: Supports the body
[[Skeleton types]]

-- Hydrostatic -- 
Circular muscles ::: These narrow and elongate the body, pushing segments forward
Longitudinal muscles ::: These shortend the body, pulling any trailing segments forward
Purpose of Cheatae :: To anchor the earthworm and prevent backsliding (BLJs)

-- Exoskeleton -- 
One of two options for advanced locomotion
How are muscles attached to the exoskeleton? :: To the joints of the exoskeleton
What is the major downside of an exoskeleton (in [[Arthropoda (Insects, Spiders, Crustaceans)]] specifically)? :: The moulting period is very vulnerable, especially during the initial moulting process and also for the soft-shell period

-- Endoskeleton -- 
What embryo layer does the endoskeleton derive from? :: The mesoderm layer
Calcium carbonate spicules are right beneath the skin that join together
Why are there skeletons of shark heads if they're made of cartilage? ::  Cartilage in shark heads likely mineralises to provide extra strength (preventing floppy jaws)

Cartilage location and purpose on the bone :: At the end, for flexibility

Bone - connective tissue (Slide 9a)

Human skeleton:
What is the shape of the human backbone and why? :: It's S-shaped and is optimised for balancing
	Pelvis is tilted upwards
	Specialised hands for manipulation rather than walking
	Feet for body support

Bird skeleton:
	Like honeycomb, with many air-pockets for weight reduction
		Stores some oxygen
		Bones that are important are denser (joints, heads, protection)
	A frigate bird with a wingspan of 2m has a 113g skeleton


[[Muscles]]
13a-14b

**Vertebrate skeletal muscle** 
Skeletal muscle is made up of
• bundles of parallel muscle fibres
• each fibre is a single cell with many nuclei and contains a bundle of myofibrils
• a myofibril consists of repeating units called sarcomeres
• the region between 2 dark narrow lines called Z lines in the myofibril

Myofibril (protein filaments) - thin filaments of actin/regulatory proteins
Thick filaments - myosin molecules
Actin  :: Act-thin

Sarcomeres move past each other when contracting/relaxing
- the functional units of the muscle
- shorten when thin slide across thick towards sarcomere centre
- filament length stays the same



Z-line is the boundary between sarcomeres

![[Week 6b - Musculoskeletal System.pdf#page=16]]
Rigomortis is caused by myosin heads not having any ATP to move

$Ca^{2+}$ ions can bind with the regulatory protein Troponin and bind to myosin binding sites to allow muscles to contract
	This process seems silly but it prevents random spasming

Muscles are stimulated by motor neuron cells releasing acetylcholine (ACH) 
- Sarcoplasmic reticulum (specialised ER in muscle cells)
	- Permeability shifts to release calcium ions

1 myofibril can be hundreds of thousands of sarcomeres spread over tens of cells

Motor unit :: Single motor nerve cell and muscle fibres it controls
What happens when a motor nerve cell fires? :: All the fibres in the motor unit contract
What does muscle action strength depend on? :: How many motor units are activated
DIAGARM on SLIDE 18b

![[Week 6b - Musculoskeletal System.pdf#page=19]]

What does the variation in the frequency of nerve impulses affect? :: The strength of the muscle response (not always though)

What happens when a second impulse (action potential) occurs before a first action potential has been responded to? :: The signals will compound and provide a larger muscle contraction

T tubule causes sarcoplasmic reticulum leak
