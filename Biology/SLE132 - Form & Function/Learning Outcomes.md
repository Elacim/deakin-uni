## Topic 1 - Structure and Function of Animals
### Topic overview
##### Topic overview: unifying structure and function
Two major themes will underpin this topic. One is the correlation of structure with function. For instance the structure of muscle at the gross, tissue, cellular and molecular levels is related to its function—contraction. A second major theme involves the capacity of multicellular organisms to adjust to changes in the environment. In this topic we will concentrate on physiological processes that contribute to such adjustments.

##### Key concepts to be developed in this topic
- [ ] The organisation of a body plan emerges from the grouping of specialised cells into tissues, tissues into organs and organs into organ systems.
- [ ] The function of cells, tissues and organs is related to their structure.
    - [ ] Development is the process of a single fertilised egg cell giving rise to a specific form consisting of many differentiated cells organised into specialised tissues and organs.
    - [ ] Most multicellular organisms have a circulatory system for the internal transport of gases, nutrients and waste.
    - [ ] Efficient respiratory membranes need to be thin, moist, well ventilated and have a large surface area.
    - [ ] Homeostasis is the maintenance of an internal steady state in the face of environmental fluctuations.
    - [ ] The endocrine system produces chemical messengers, called hormones, from endocrine glands. Hormones control activities at target organs.
    - [ ] Nervous systems receive sensory information, interpret it and send out commands to produce the appropriate response.

## Topic 2 - Structure and Function of Plants
### Topic overview
Much of life as we know it relies on plants, for they provide the oxygen in the air we breathe and the organic materials that we and other organisms use as food. Plants are an integral and essential component of our lives. This topic will describe how plants develop from seed to maturity and how they reproduce, as well as the variety of ways in which plants have adapted to different habitats. The topic will also consider how knowledge of plant function can be applied to a range of environmental problems such as lowered water tables and salinity.

Topic 2 begins with an introduction to plant taxonomy and an evolutionary look at the diversity of plants including mosses, ferns and gymnosperms. This is followed by an examination of the structure and function of flowering plants. Aspects to be covered include plant structure and growth, reproduction, transport, nutrition, photosynthesis, and control systems. A basic understanding of plant structure, anatomy and function is important because it relates directly to how we can and do use plants and plant products. We can also better understand how plants interact with their environment and the environmental constraints on plant distribution. Photosynthesis is a major plant function and is essential to animal life on earth, and the movement of water through plants, transpiration, enables them to survive in the terrestrial environment. Plant function and development is controlled by both external and internal cues that regulate specific molecules, hormones, in the plant. Hormones act with environmental stimuli to guide growth and development.

The topic will conclude with an introduction to the Protists and this group’s photosynthetic members, the algae, along with the kingdom, Fungi and the lichens.

##### Key concepts to be developed in this topic
- [ ] For all plants, structure and function are related.
- [ ] Three tissue systems make up the plant body.
    - [ ] Plants have a variety of reproductive structures and strategies including sexual reproduction, asexual reproduction and vegetative reproduction.
    - [ ] Plants acquire their nutrients from soil and the air, and they have structures and mechanisms to enable them to achieve this.
    - [ ] Plant hormones have an important role in controlling plant functions.
    - [ ] Plants vary in their adaptations to life on land.
        - [ ] Algae and fungi are also eukaryotes but show many differences to plants and animals.
