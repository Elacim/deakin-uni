What is an animal? :: A multicellular, eukaryotic, heterotrophic, generally mobile, held together by collagen, and sexually reproducing
Advantages of being multicellular :: Specialised cells (tissues), a larger size can be maintained (SA:V limitations are overcome), a big size prevents predation and allows increased defence, the ability to obtain food/energy, and the ability to adapt and maximise opportunity in differing environmental conditions
<!--SR:!2023-11-26,1,230-->
Disadvantages of being multicellular :: Ridding waste, gaining access to nutrients/oxygen, a more complex structure is needed

Larger and more complex animals and therefore need systems in place to transport substances in/away from cells not interfacing with the environment - PAGE 16a, b for diagram

Purpose of a high SA:V ratio :: To minimise transportation costs and to maximise diffusion potential for waste and resources

Largest plant cell - *Valonia ventricosa* (bubble algae)


**Kingdoms**
Phylum: Annelida - Segmented worms
Phylum: Arthropoda - Insects
Phylum: Chordata - Hollow dorsal nerve cord

Species are groups of individuals that can interbreed and produce offspring that are capable of reproducing
	`Horse: 2n=64 x Donkey: 2n=62 -> Mule: 2n=63 - sterile/infertile`

1.3 million species of animals have been named - which is suspected to be less than 20% of living species
	Guessed to be 10-200 million species
[[Binomial nomenclature]]

Phylogeny :: Evolutionary history of a species/group of species
SLIDE 23b

Phylogenetic trees :: Used to show divergence points to build up a tree of life
[[Phylogenetics]]


**Phyla classification of animals**
- Symmetry
	- Radial -> all sides have euq
	- bilateral, asymmetry

Radial symmetry :: Round around a central point (think anenome)
<!--SR:!2023-11-28,3,250-->
Benefits of radial symmetry :: All equal side can catch prey

Bilateral symmetry :: Cut along one plane gives a mirror image. Anterior and posterior axis
Bilateral movement - paired appendages allow movement a lot easier than if it was radial
Bilateral sensory equipment location :: The head (anterior) and sometimes a Central Nervous System 
What is 'Cephalisation'? :: The anterior have concentrated sensory organs/facilities
Cephal- suffix meaning :: "Head"
-Derm :: "Skin"/Layer

**Skeletons: Slide 6**
- Hydrostatic Skeleton —A skeletal system composed Of fluid held under
pressure in a closed body compartment
- Exoskeleton — A hard encasement on the surface of an animal
- Endoskeleton — internal skeleton/support structures
- Notocord — a longitudinal, flexible rod made Of tightly packed
mesodermal cells that runs anterior to posterior (in humans the spinal
column)

**Segmentation**
- Serial Segmentation — the animal body is characterised by the repetition of similar segments.
- Segmentation - characterised by non-repeating segments (Think of the segments of an ant or spider.)

**Appendages**
- Any and all extensions of an animal
	- Limbs, claws, tentacles, antennae
	- Locomotion appendages (legs)

**Mouth and anus**
- Having both is more efficient - as it goes further down the line, nutrients are sucked up better (longer time spent = more nutrients digested)
- Having only one can lead to mixing stale/new food

- Body cavity type
	- Platyhelminthes
		- Coelomate - true coelom or a body cavity completely lined by tissue from the mesoderm (earthworms)
		- Pseocoelomate
		- Acoelomate - lacks a body cavity
- Cephalisation

**Body plans**
- Single cells: no cell walls, organelles
- Multicellular
	- Parazoa: Cell aggregate (Porifera)
	- Eumetazoa: Tissue
		- Radial symmetry: bi-blastic (diploblastic)
			- Ecto and endoderm
		- Bilaterla symmetry: organs, tri-blastic (triploblastic)
			- Ecto, meso, and endoderm

Sessile - anchored, doesn't move

True tissues/organs - extracellular matrix
Non-true tissues/organs - a cellular colony

Digest :: Take in
Egest :: Spit out

## [[Animal Phylums]]
**Phylum - Porifera**
- Sponges! - anatomy on slide 11a
- Now known as two phylums: Calcarea ('of calcium') and Silicea ('of silicon') - meaning their skeletons/spicules are calcium carbonate/silica dioxide
- Sedentary, living in fresh and marine waters
- Doesn't have True tissues or Organs
- Suspension feeders - passing food is sucked through
- No (observable) symmetry
- Hermaphroditic

Choanocytes are flagellated collar cells that generate water currents for the sponge
	- Water is drawn into the spongocoel cavity through pores

**Phylum - Cnidaria**
- Jellyfish, corals, hydras
	- Hydrozoa
	- Scyphozoa (most jellies)
	- Cubozoa (some jellies)
	- Anthozoa (sea anenomes)
- Knide - nettle, stinging cells
- Sac with a central digestive chamber and a gastrovascular cavity
- Sessile polyp and motile medusa
- Nearly completely carnivorous
	- Use Cnidocytes that defend the organism and predate
		-  Nematocysts (specialised organelles within cnidocytes that eject a stinging thread)
	- Can have tentacles for different purposes
		- Stinging
		- Feeding/capture

**Phylum - Platyhelminthes**
LOOK at SLIDE 14a for ANATOMY PICTURE
- Platy: "Flat", Helminth: "worm"
