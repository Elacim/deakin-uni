###### [[#Signs of deficiency]]
Chlorosis :: The paling of leaves due to a lack of chlorophyll production
$\ce{CO2}$ ($\ce{O \& C}$) :: Poor growth
$\ce{H2O (H)}$ :: Wilting and poor growth
$\ce{NO3^{-}/NH4^{+}}$ :: Chlorosis at the tips of older leaves; stunted growth; being common in soils with low organic materials or heavily cultivated soils
$\ce{K+}$ :: Older leaves being mottled and developing dried edges; stems are developed weak; poorly developed roots, being common in acidic/sandy soils
$\ce{Ca^{2+}}$ :: Young leaf crinkling; terminal buds dying, being common in acidic/sandy soils
$\ce{Mg^{2+}}$ :: Chlorosis showing in older leaves first, being common in acidic/sandy soils
$\ce{H2PO4-/HPO4^{2-}}$ :: Healthy but extremely slowed development; stems are developed thin (spindly, brittle); veins/underside are purple-red; poor flowering and fruit production, being common in acidic/wet/cold soils
$\ce{SO4^{2-}}$ :: General chlorosis in young leaves, being common in sandy or continuously soaked soils
