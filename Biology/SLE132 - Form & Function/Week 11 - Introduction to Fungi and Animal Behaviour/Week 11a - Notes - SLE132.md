## Fungi
Fungi are an extremely diverse and widespread kingdom
What are fungi cells? :: Eukaryotic chitinous cell walls
Why different to bugs? :: Different chitin locations
Lifestyles :: Decomposers, mutualists, and parasitic

Fungi can be considered as recyclers, though this is not exclusive

The mushroom is a sporophore
Mycelium is made of hyphae cells

Type of troph :: Heterotrophic
How do fungi digest? :: Externally by secreting digestive enzymes then absorbing the resulting, broken down compounds
Ecological importance :: Decomposing dead organic material then the return of these nutrients (such as $\ce{P or N}$) to the environment
Relationship with most plants :: Mutualistic

What can fungi eat? :: Anything really - clothes, plastic, cables/wires, food, optics, and paint
Are all fungi pathogens? :: No, they aren't and also, not all produce toxins (30% of known are pathogenic or parasitic)
Yeasts uses :: Brewing/baking, antibiotics, mycorrhizal associations

#### Structure
What type of organism are yeasts? :: Unicellular
What are most fungi? :: Filamentous (multicellular)
		hyphae (branching filaments) in multicellular fungi
		main body = mycleium (SLIDE 3a - diagram)

#### Reproduction
- Lots of spores (sexual or asexual)
SLIDE 3b - diagram

Fungi have different mating types, not really genders. They have different sexual signalling molecules (pheromones) to communicate this.
Plasmogamy :: Union of two parent mycelia (cytoplasm fusion)
	Length - hours to centuries, until suitable conditions (usually seasonal - wait till winter for wet)
	This creates a dikaryotic organism (n + n) as nuclear material is unfused

Karyogamy :: Fusion of nuclei, creating a diploid zygote
	Length - short, meisos occurs to produce haploid spores


Sexual:
1. Two mating types fuse (plasmogamy)
2. n + n (dikaryotic) mycelium results, overtakes haploid parent
3. Environmental cues induce a [[#Basidiocarp/Basidomycota|basidiocarp]] (puffballs, mushrooms, etc.)
4. Basidiocarp gills lined with dikaryotic basidia cells
5. Karyogamy to create a diploid nucleus, soon after undergoing meiosis
6. 4 haploid spores per each diploid nucleus
7. Spores develop into basidiospore
8. Basidium releases basidiospores into the wind
9. Basidiospores germinate into short-lived haploid mycelia once a suitable environment is reached
10. Repeat cycle

**Asexual reproduction**
Mycelium -> sporophores -> spores -> germination -> mycelium etc.
Yeasts - cell division OR pinching off of bud cells from parent cells


#### Taxonomy
Zygomycota (moulds)
Ascomycota (yeasts, sac fungi)
Basidomycota (mushies/toadstools)
Chytrids
Glomeromycetes

30% of known fungi are parasites/pathogens
	Exist on or in plants
Fungi also attack good crops, are toxic to humans, while others attack bad plants

Mutualistic relationships - slide 7b

Mycorrhizae gain sugar from host plant, host plant has increased SA:V for water uptake and mineral absorption
###### Basidiocarp/Basidomycota
Basidomycota
	25k species
	Mushies
	Puffballs
	Toadstools
	Shelf fungi

Basidiocarp - elaborate fruiting bodies (like mushrooms)
	Contains basidia
		Which are the source of sexual basidiospores

### Lichen
Lichens are rarely studied, Australia being particularly rare.
What is a lichen? :: A photosynthetic organism (like an algage/cyanobacteria) symbiotically bonding with a fungi
What does the fungi provide? :: Protection and a structure for the photosynthetic cells
What does the photosynthetic cells provide? :: Sugars

Lichen components :: Ascomycete + Basciomycete + photosynthetic thing
Structure :: Millions of photosynthetic held in fungal hyphae
SLIDE 9a

##### Role of fungi
Fungi role
Big part of the food web, being eaten by reindeer and invertebrates
- shelter + nesting material
- prevent soil erosion + form crust on soil
- promote soil production (rock erosion by chemicals and nutrients/organic matter to soil by decay)
- may contain nitrogen-fixing bacteria

###### Biomonitoring using lichen
Biomonitors :: Reflectors of environmental state over time
- Desertification
	- Satellite imagery to detect lichen crust presence
- Forest dieback
	- Abnormal lichen growths
- Indicator species
	- Forest health
- Air pollution
	- Don't grow in polluted areas

###### Uses of lichen
- Secondary compounds are common -> antibiotic affects
- High UV absorption -> sunscreen
- Lichen polysaccharides -> anti-tumours, anti-viral, anti-inflammatory

#### Distribution of lichen
Are most lichens endemic? :: Very few due to ease-of-spread
Main limiting factors :: Suitable ecological conditions
Speed of growth? :: Slow
