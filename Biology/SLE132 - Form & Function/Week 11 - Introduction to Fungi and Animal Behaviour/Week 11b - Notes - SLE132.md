Ethology ::: Name for the study of animal behaviour
Animal behaviour? :: An action [[Responding to stimuli|responding to stimuli]] that is executed by muscles/glands by control of the nervous system

[[Week 11b - Animal Behaviour.pdf]]

Simple version of animal behaviour? :: What an animal does

Everything can be boiled down to surviving and reproducing
##### Animal examples
###### Male silky anole
Slide 2a
Dewlap for mate attraction, species recognition, territorial reasons

- Crab migration on christmas island

- Bee waggle round dance

##### Proximate causation
? :: The 'how' of a behaviour
Focus :: The triggering environmental stimuli and genetic/physiological/anatomical processes
Nature vs nurture :: How does development influence behaviour
##### Ultimate causation
? :: The 'why' of a behaviour
Main focus :: The evolutionary history and significance
Factors in this? :: Evolutionary struggles - survival, reproduction


##### Nature vs nurture
Nature? :: Genetic components influencing behaviour
Nurture? :: Environmental components influencing behaviour
Debate over? :: Degree of what influences displayed phenotypic traits
What is behaviour (genetically)? :: Phenotypic trait
	Variance is common in individuals, environments, times

#### Innate behaviours (Slide 3b)
Genetically programmed behaviour

Requirements to be classified as innate
?
- Heritable (DNA encoded, generation to generation)
- Intrinsic (present )
- Stereotypic
- Inflexible 
- Consummate

Hertiable :: DNA encoded and from generation to generation
Intrinsic :: Present in isolated-raised animals
Stereotypic :: Performed the same way in each species
Inflexible :: Experience or development intolerant
Consummate :: Fully developed or expressed on first go


##### Behaviour patterns (Fixed Action Patterns) (Slide 4a)
? :: Coordianted movements done in sequence as a unit - no interruptions regardless of change in stimuli
	Can involve whole-body movements, not simple reflexes
			Requires a threshld to do it
Advantage? :: If there is something that needs to be acted upon, it will be avoided/gotten

Reflex :: Simplest behaviour, non-CNS response
Oriented movement :: Movement rseponding to external stimuli 

Kinesis :: Non-directional change in activity/turning rate
Taxis :: Oriented movement towards/away from stimuli
Migration :: Long-distance change in locations
Behavioural rhythms :: Controlled/repeated to changes in light, seasons

Common examples :: Courtship, striking at prey, food gathering, hunting, nest-buliding, escape

###### Egg-rolling grey la(e)g goose
Grey le(a)g Geese roll eggs into their nest - or even egg shaped objects like cue balls or babushaka dolls, bottles, porcelain, boxes
	Eggs may be weirdly shaped, odd colours
		Best chance for survival
	Goose egg-rolling by Rachel Doyle

###### Male three-spined stickleback fish
Slide 5a-5b
Decoys trigger attack response

Red belly = attack
Swollen belly = courtship

###### Kinesis
Slide 6b

###### Taxis
Slide 7a
Similar to plant tropisms, where moving away or towards stimuli
Algae move towards light (positive phototaxis)
Fish going against the current (positive rheotaxis)

###### Migration
Use the :: Suns, stars, magnetic field
Most known :: Birds and insects (like locusts)


###### Behavioural rhythms
Influences hibernation/migration times
Male fiddler crab syncs to tidal rhythms

##### Animal signals and communications
? :: Transmission and reception of signals
Signal types? :: Visual/auditory/chemical/tacticle
Pheremones? :: Chemicals that transmit species-specific info

Bee waggle dance
	1 second/loop = 1km

![[Week 11b - Notes - Bee waggle dance.png]]


## Learned Behaviours
? :: Variable behaviours, dependent on experience

Habituation :: Loss of response to a stimuli that contains little/no new information
	Other name :: Boy who cried wolf effect

##### Spatial learning
Spatial learning :: Establishment of memory that reflects environmental spatial structure
Cognitive maps :: Neuron-encoded map of spatial environment

Digger wasps

The wasps flew to the nest where the location was changed, showing that spatial awareness was used rather than something like chemical signals.
![[Week 11b - Notes - Digger wasp, spatial learning.png]]

##### Imprinting
? :: Long-lasting behavioural response to a particular object/individual
Difference between other learned behaviours? :: Sensitive time frame (early in life)

Exampels :: Cat acting like a dog, vice versa

##### Associative learning
? :: Association of a stimulus with another
Types? :: Classical conditioning and operant conditioning
Classical conditioning :: Arbitrary stimulus is tied to an outcome (like Pavlov's dog)
Operant conditioning :: Trial & error learning (usually self-learning); association of a behaviour to internal or external reward/punishment
![[Week 11b - Notes - Blue jay eating a butterfly (associative learning).png]]

##### Cognition and problem solving
Slide 14b
Cognition :: One of the most complex learning forms, process of knowing represented aware
	Reasoning
	Recollection
	Judgement

Problem solving :: Activity of devising a method to proceed from one state to another to overcome real/apparent obstacles

## Social behaviour
? :: Interaction between 2+ animals, usually from the same species
Examples? :: Aggression, cooperation, courtship, and rarely, deception

#### Agonist behaviour
? :: Threatening/submissive behaviour to determine resource access
Mainly ritualistic, non-fighiting
Minimise injury
Reconciliation often happens - no grudges are held as it would not help anything

Escalation behaviours :: Increasing aggression threat signals
Submission behaviours :: Deescalating signals through submission (increasing fear)

#### Dominance hierarchies
? :: Top rank dominates over lower members
Wolf example :: Dominant female who controls mating
Meerkat example :: Dominant alpha pair
Top ranked animal :: Guaranteed access to resources
Lower ranked :: No waste of energy/risk harm

Pecking order came from observing domestic hens
Lower ranked birds never peck high ranked birds

Help with? :: Stable population by ensuring enough reproduction occurs

#### Territoriality
Territories? :: Mating/feeding/young-rearing areas that are defended
Territory size? :: Species, function, and resource dependent
Downsides? :: Resource-expensive, defence might result in death/reproductive opportunity

Sometimes only during certain times like mating seasons - magpies

Frilled neck lizards make themselves look big

##### Spraying
? :: Marks territory either with urine or chemicals

### Courtship and mating behaviours
Slide 20b

Partner doing the rituals is usually more colourful/showy - less blending in with the environment
Maximises quantity/quality of mating partners
Male building nest purpose :: Shows that the male is fit for reproduction due to strength and building ability

Blue Satin Bird
Blue footed boobies
Peacock spider
3-spined stickleback fish


![[Week 11b - Notes - Three-Spined stickleback courtship.png]]

#### Parental investment
Females tend to spend more energy making eggs, meaning they are usually the deciding parent
Why are females usually the deciding partner? :: They make larger and fewer gametes which is energetically expensive, making each gamete more valuable
Male are usually lower investments as they produce lots and lots of small gametes, and they usually have not much paternal care


##### Mating systems
Promiscuous :: No long relationships or paired bonds
Monogamous :: Long-term bond (not life-long, as it is extremely rare)

Polygamous :: An individual of one sex mating with several of a sex
Polygyny :: Single male mates with many females
Polyandry :: One female with several males (common in birds)
	Birds have adaptations to take out sperm from the female cloaca

#### Altruistic behaviour
Altruism :: Selflessness that reduces an individual's fitness to increase population fitness
Pied Butcher bird alarm call :: Warns others, increases self-risk of harm
Rats - save drowning friends

Naked mole rats (Slide 23a) - like a bee colony where they protect the king/queen with their lives
