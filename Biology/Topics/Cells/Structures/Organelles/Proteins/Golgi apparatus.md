![[Golgi apparatus - Exocytosis.webp|400]]
- stacks aren't interconnected
- modifies protein sugars
- Receiving side - accepts transport vesicles from rough ER
- Shipping side - forms transport vesicles for transporting out plasma membrane/organelle
- High protein production and secretion - lots of golgi stacks

##### Purpose
Transporting, modification, and packaging of proteins, lipids into vesicles.

These vesicles may go intracellular or extracellular environs.
