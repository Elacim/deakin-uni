- [[Mitochondrial DNA]]

mtDNA mutates greater than nuclear DNA in animals
- substitution rate at silent sites is 10-20x higher than in nuclear

- mtDNA frequently replicates within non-dividing cells increasing opportunities for replication errors per cell cycle
- Mitochondria contain multiple genomic copies increasing mutational targets

The increased mutation rate of mtDNA is caused by the lack of protective histones and proximity to the site of free radical- generating oxidative phosphorylation
