A cascade of signals triggered by a receptor being stimulated, leading to a response by the cell 
It may also be called a **signal cascade**.

What is the first step in signal transduction? :: Reception.
What is the second step in signal transduction? :: Transduction.
What is the third step in signal transduction? :: Response.

What occurs in reception? :: A receptor ('lock') on a cell receives a hormone ('key')
What occurs in transduction? :: Various relay proteins and secondary messengers amplify and relay the signal
What occurs in the response step? :: The signal is received and the desired effect enacted

What primarily occurs as a response? :: A gene turning on or off
