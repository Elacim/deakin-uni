What is the metaphase plate? :: An imaginary line going through the centre of a cell that the tetrads line up at

What are the primary differences between mitosis metaphase and meiosis metaphase I? :: Rather than a pair of chromosomes lining up at the metaphase plate and facing each pole of the cell, it is instead tetrads that line up. Microtubules then connect to the kinetochore of one chromosome from each tetrad rather than the centromere of a chromosome

What lines up at the metaphase I plate? :: Tetrads (two homologous chromosome pairs)

What part of a chromosome do microtubules connect to? :: Kinetochore of one chromosome
What direction do tetrads line up at the metaphase I plate? :: The face perpendicular to the centrioles (|- or -|)
Where are the tetrads positioned on the metaphase I plate? :: Along the cell equator between the centrioles (•|•)

What is the [[Law of Independent Assortment]]? :: The random orientation of chromosomes, allowing increased genetic diversity
