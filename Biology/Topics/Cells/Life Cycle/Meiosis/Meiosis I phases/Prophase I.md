#### Overview
How much of Meiosis is spent in prophase I? :: Roughly 90% of time required for meiosis

What is the purpose of prophase I?
?
- To condense chromatin in chromosomes
- Homologous chromosomes are paired into tetrads
- Undergo recombination (crossing over)

##### Phases of Prophase I
?
?
1. Leptotene ('thin threads')
2. Zygotene ('paired threads')
3. Pachytene ('thick threads')
4. Diplotene ('two threads')
5. Diakinesis ('moving through')
