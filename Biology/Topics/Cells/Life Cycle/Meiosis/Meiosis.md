? :: Cell division that produces four haploid cells with only one paternal/maternal chromosome each.

What is the goal of meiosis? :: To produce genetically distinct gametes for maximal variation and survival opportunity

At what phase of meiosis does crossing over occur? :: Prophase I
At what phase of meiosis does [[Law of Independent Assortment|independent assortment]] occur? :: Metaphase I

How many chromosomes are present in mitosis? 

Is meiosis limited to cell type? :: Yes, only eukaryotic, germline (sex) stem cells undergo meiosis shown here [[Meiosis - Spermatogenesis and Oogenesis.png]]

In females, eggs are there from birth and stay in meiosis I

In comparing mitosis metaphase and meiosis metaphase I, why does the same amount of genetic material (`2x46=`92 chromatids) result in different outcomes?
?
In metaphase, homologous chromosomes line up like ----, whereas in metaphase, homologous chromosomes pair up and line up like ==== along the metaphase plate. This means that in metaphase, the chromatids are pulled apart while in metaphase I, the paired chromosomes are pulled away from each other


Animals:
1. 2 haploid cells (sperm and an egg) fuse to form a diploid cell (zygote)
2. This zygote splits through mitosis and proliferates into a full organism
3. Germ cells split through meiosis to form either haploid eggs or sperm


What 3 events are exclusive to meiosis? :: In prophase I, synapsis and crossing over; In metaphase I, paired homologous chromosomes (tetrads) split; and in Anaphase I, the separation of homologous chromosomes

- modified type of cell division (only in sexually reproduction)
	- unlike mitosis, daughter cells have genetically distinct makeup
	- similar to mitosis, meiosis is preceded by chromosome replication
- two rounds of cell division
- one round of DNA replication
- Result is cells with half the number of chromosomal sets as the original
	- 4 daughter cells



### Meiosis II
After meiosis I, meiosis II starts with 2 genetically distinct diploid (2n) cells 

In the context of human cells, why are chromosomes not replicated again before Meiosis II? :: When haploid gametes fuse, they form a diploid cell (a 2n zygote), because of this, if the chromosomes were further replicated instead of being reduced, the fused gametes would form a debilitating tetraploid cell (4n)

- very similar to **mitosis**
	- key difference is the amount of genetic material
- In metaphase II, two sister chromatids of each chromosome are no longer genetically identical (due to crossing over in meiosis I)
