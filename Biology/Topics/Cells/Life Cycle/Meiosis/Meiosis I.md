In what phase does [[Crossing over|crossing over]] occur? :: Prophase I

In what phase does the [[Law of Independent Assortment]] take place?
?
Metaphase I and Metaphase II as the sister chromatids (in Metaphase I) or single chromatids (in Metaphase II) line up on the metaphase plate


After the DNA duplication done in $S$ phase, meiosis I starts with two homologous pairs of chromosomes

- preceded by interphase (where chromosomes are replicated - sister chromatids)
	- genetically identical, joined at centromere
In what Meiosis phase does chromosome condensation occur? :: Prophase I

What does the synaptonemal complex do? :: It tightly connects homologous chromosomes along their lengths during prophase I


At what phase is DNA condensed into chromosomes? :: Prophase I

###### Prophase I

What are homologous chromosome pairs held together by? :: Chiasma and sister chromatid cohesion proteins (cohesin)
What is 'cohesin' and it's purpose? :: A protein complex that holds homologous chromosome pairs together, known as sister chromatid cohesion
What is the purpose of pairing homologous chromosomes? :: It allows high levels of recombination to occur and is sensical for the segregation of chromosomes in Anaphase I

What is synapsis? :: The loose pairing up of homologous chromosomes and the alignment of them gene-by-gene
What is crossing over? :: It occurs during synapsis and is where non-sister chromatids exchange DNA segments, also known as recombination
What is a tetrad? :: Two chromosome pairs which are 4 chromatids
