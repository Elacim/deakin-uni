What are these made of? :: Microtubules which themselves are made of tubulin protein subunits.

What phase are these formed in and from what source? :: They are formed by [[Centrosome|centrosomes]] during [[Prometaphase (Late prophase) (2)]]


##### Kinetochore vs. non-kinetochore spindle fibres
What is the main purpose of non-kinetochore spindle fibres? :: Lengthening and elongation of the cell


What is the main purpose of kinetochore spindle fibres?
?
They connect to the kinetochore of chromosomes during [[Metaphase (3)]] and they pull the sister chromatids away during [[Anaphase (4)]]
