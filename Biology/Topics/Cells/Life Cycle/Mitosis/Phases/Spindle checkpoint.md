? :: Monitoring of kinetochore $\leftrightarrow$ spindle fibre connections to ensure proper attachment

Activated function :: Blocks [[Anaphase (4)]] entry until connections are set
Deactivated function :: Permits entry to [[Anaphase (4)]]


How is the spindle checkpoint deactivated?
?
The [[Chromatid|sister chromatids]] are correctly orientated


How does the spindle checkpoint 'know' the sister chromatids are correctly oriented?
?
By monitoring the tension of the kinetochore to the opposite spindle pole. When correctly attached, the mitotic spindle is then under tension.
