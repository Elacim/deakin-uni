#### Overview
? :: The cell is alive and metabolically active, but non-dividing

Name for a dormant cell :: Quiescent; dormant; asleep

Why would a cell enter G0?
?
- Environmental factors like nutrient deprivation
- Genetic programming, like in neurons

What cells rarely enter G0? :: [[Epithelial tissues|Epithelial cells]]

How are cells determined to be in (reversible, quiescent) G0?
?
- Low RNA content
- Lack of cell proliferation markers
- Labels placed on DNA not disappearing fast, indicating a slow cell turnover. These cells are called Label-Retaining Cells (LRCs)
