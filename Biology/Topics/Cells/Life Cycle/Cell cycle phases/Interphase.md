#### Overview
###### Phases
What phases of the cell cycle does interphase have?
?
$G_{1}$ (and $G_{0}$), $S$ phase, $G_{2}$ phase

How much of the cell cycle is spent in interphase? :: Up to 90% of the time

What phases out of G1, G0, S, G2, and M last roughly the same amount of time regardless of cell type? :: S and G2

The cell can appear to be dormant but there is high biochemical activity.


###### Chromosomes
-> [[Chromosomes]]
In what form are chromosomes in during interphase? :: Loose, [[Chromatin|euchromatin]]
