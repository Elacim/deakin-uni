#### Overview
What does the G stand for? :: Growth or gap
What overall phase of the cell life cycle is G1 a part of? :: Interphase
What phase occurs after G1? :: G0 or S phase
What phase is before G1? :: Commonly M phase but sometimes the G0 phase if a cell is being reactivated

###### Purpose
Main purposes of G1
?
- Physical growth
- Duplication of organelles
- Protein/mRNA synthesis necessary for DNA synthesis

Do cells grow in G1? :: Yes, they grow physically larger; cytoplasm volume is increased
How are organelles affected in G1? :: They are duplicated

###### DNA and chromosomes
Ploidy of a G1 cell? :: 2n. There are two sets of chromosomes.

How is the genetic material of a G1 cell structured? :: Loosely, in chromatin form.

How does G1 contribute to DNA synthesis? :: Necessary mRNA and proteins are synthesised. No DNA is synthesised yet.


###### Misc.
What type of human cells will *never* enter G1? :: Brain and heart cells

What type of humans cells will *rarely* enter G1? :: Liver and kidney cells

When will human cells that rarely enter G1 enter G1? :: When signalled to do so
