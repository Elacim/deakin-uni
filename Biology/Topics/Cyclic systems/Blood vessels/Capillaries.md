What is exchanged to and from capillaries? :: Resources like oxygen, $CO_{2}$, and glucose
What is a requirement for oxygen/$CO_{2}$ diffusion? :: They need to be dissolved in water
Where can molecules diffuse? :: Through and between epithelial cells
Proteins - stay in blood

| Molecule | Blood | Tissue |
| -------- | ----- | ------ |
| Oxygen   | high  | low    |
| CO2      | low   | high   |
| Glucose  | high  | low    |
|          |       |        |

Lymph capillaries??

If going from the right ventricle to the right atrium, at a minimum, how many capillary beds would a red blood cell go through? :: Two. Right ventricle -> pulmonary artery -> pulmonary capillary bed -> left ventricle -> capillary bed-> organs -> inferior vena cava -> right atrium
