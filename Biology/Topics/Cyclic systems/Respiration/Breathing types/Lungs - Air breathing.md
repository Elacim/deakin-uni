What are lungs? :: Internally located moist sacs 
<!--SR:!2023-12-01,4,270-->
What are the components of lungs? :: Air tubes with alveoli
<!--SR:!2023-11-30,3,250-->
## Structure
What are air tubes lined with? :: Mucus secreting, ciliated epithelium
<!--SR:!2023-11-28,1,230-->
What keeps air tubes lubricated? :: Epithelium which secret mucus
<!--SR:!2023-11-30,3,250-->
What are alveoli and their basic structure? :: Moist squamous epithelium lined sacs
<!--SR:!2023-11-30,3,250-->
What is the surface area of a single human lung? :: $80m^{2}$
<!--SR:!2023-11-30,3,250-->
Roughly how many alveoli are in a single human lung? :: 300 million alveoli/lung
<!--SR:!2023-11-28,1,230-->
What is the single opening that mammals have for breathing? :: The trachea
<!--SR:!2023-11-30,3,250-->
Where are lungs found and why? :: At one location for optimising air intake 
<!--SR:!2023-12-01,4,270-->
What is the disadvantage of lungs being singly located? :: The body requires a circulatory system to transport air
<!--SR:!2023-11-28,1,230-->

What is the benefit of lungs being found internally? :: It significantly reduces water loss
<!--SR:!2023-12-01,4,270-->

## Breath
Normal breath volume in humans :: $0.5L$
<!--SR:!2023-11-28,1,230-->
Maximum lung inhalation/exhalation capacity in humans :: $3.5...4.8L$ 
<!--SR:!2023-11-30,3,250-->
What does 'vital capacity' mean in reference to the respiratory system? :: The maximum lung inhalation and exhalation volume
<!--SR:!2023-11-30,3,250-->
What does 'tidal volume' mean in reference to the respiratory system? :: The regular amount of air inhaled/exhaled per regular breath 
<!--SR:!2023-11-30,3,250-->

Do our lungs completely lose air? :: They don't - think of it like an uninflated balloon - it's hard to get them kickstarted if they lose all air
<!--SR:!2023-12-01,4,270-->

What is the process of inhalation in negative pressure ventilation? :: Ribs muscles and diaphragm contract, increasing pressure -> chest cavity increases in volume -> lungs expand and suck in air
<!--SR:!2023-11-28,1,230-->

The diaphragm contracts and moves downwards during... :: Inhalation

What is the process of exhalation in negative pressure ventilation? :: Ribs muscles and diaphragm relax, decreasing pressure -> chest cavity decreases in volume -> lungs increase in pressure and force air out
<!--SR:!2023-11-28,1,230-->
Why does air feel forced to leave us? :: Pressure build-up
<!--SR:!2023-11-30,3,250-->


## Non-mammals
Aside from mammals, what other species have lungs independently evolved from? :: Spiders, land-based slugs/snails, and vertebrates
<!--SR:!2023-11-28,1,230-->
Name for the lungs of a spider :: Booklung
<!--SR:!2023-12-01,4,270-->
Name for the lungs of birds :: Long tubes
<!--SR:!2023-11-30,3,250-->

#### Frogs
Frogs ventilation type :: Positive pressure ventilation
<!--SR:!2023-12-01,4,270-->
What are frog lungs? :: Simple vascular sacs, no branching, folding.
<!--SR:!2023-11-28,1,230-->
What is special about frog respiration? :: Aside from simple lungs, can also breathe through their skin, known as [[Cutaneous breathing|cutaneous breathing]]
<!--SR:!2023-12-01,4,270-->

What is the inhalation process for frogs (when using their lungs)? :: Mouth muscles drop the buccal cavity (mouth), allowing air to fill the space. The cavity is the
<!--SR:!2023-11-30,3,250-->
Mouth + nostril are closed, then mouth muscles go back up, forcing air into lungs

What is the exhalation process for frogs (when using their lungs)? :: Lungs recoil elastically and force the air out the lungs; body wall compresses to help air out too
<!--SR:!2023-11-28,1,230-->
Mouth name in frogs :: Buccal cavity
<!--SR:!2023-12-01,4,270-->

#### Birds
More efficient than mammals
Two sets of air sacs w/ one wat flow. Positive pressure
Fresh and stale air don't mix
Air tubes (no alveoli) allow for [[Counter-current exchange|counter-current exchange]]

First inhalation - posterior air sacs filled
First exhalation - posterior air sacs contract, air is pushed into lungs
Second inhalation - anterior air sacs are filled after being passed through lungs
Second exhalation - anterior air sacs contract, first inhalation air is pushed out
Inhalations occur at the same time
Exhalations occur at the same time
