Advantage(s) of breathing in air :: $21\% O_{2} > ~1\%$ in $H_{2}O$, and that the energy spent breathing air is lower as it is lighter than water
Disadvantage(s) of breathing air :: Dehydration
Problems with gills in air :: They collapse, sticking together, significant water loss, and they are not optimised for air-breathing
Benefit(s) of an infolding surface for breathing :: Allows air breathing to be viable without as much dehydration
