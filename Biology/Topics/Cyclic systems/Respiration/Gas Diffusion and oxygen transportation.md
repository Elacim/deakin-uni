What does gas diffuse along? :: Pressure gradients
What is roughly the partial pressure of $O_{2}$? :: 160 mmHg
Air pressure? :: 760 mmHg
What does increased $O_{2}$ do to pressure? :: It increases pressure


**CO_2**
7% in plasma
23% to haemoglobin amino acids (not the haem)
70% as bicarbonate ions in plasma

CO2 in cells -> capillaries -> RBCs (converted to bicarbonate ions and $H^{+}$)
Bicarbonate moves into plasma
In lungs, bicarb to CO2, diffuse into alveoli then out the lungs

Bicarbonate is preferred as it will less readily diffuse out of capillaries/arteries
