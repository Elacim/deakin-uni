Skeletal muscle contracting assists with getting blood back to the heart

Pressure throughout the capillaries and why :: Capillaries are small and as they only let one RBC through, pressure stays higher
What is blood pressure? :: The force of blood on blood vessels
<!--SR:!2023-11-30,3,250-->
How is blood pressure determined? :: Cardiac output and resistance to blood flow

Where is blood pressure highest immediately after leaving the heart? :: The aorta
<!--SR:!2023-12-01,4,270-->
Where is blood pressure the lowest? :: In the veins
<!--SR:!2023-12-01,4,270-->
Which blood vessel has a mostly consistent blood pressure? :: Capillaries
<!--SR:!2023-12-01,4,270-->
What blood vessel has blood pressure significantly decrease when reached? :: Arterioles (leading into capillaries)
<!--SR:!2023-12-01,4,270-->

Rough blood pressure range for humans :: 125/75mmHg
Systolic pressure range ::: Name for pressure that is between 110-140mmHg
<!--SR:!2023-11-28,1,230-->
Diastolic pressure range ::: Name for pressure that is between 70-90mmHg
<!--SR:!2023-11-30,3,250!2023-11-28,1,230-->
What does systolic pressure sound like? :: Like flowing liquid
<!--SR:!2023-11-30,3,250-->
What does diastolic pressure sound like? :: There is no sound
<!--SR:!2023-12-01,4,270-->
What devices are used for measuring blood pressure? :: Sphygmomanometer and stethoscope
<!--SR:!2023-12-01,4,270-->

Blood vessels length in your body :: 90,000km
Blood/day :: 7,500L per day circulates, done with about 5-6L total in the body
