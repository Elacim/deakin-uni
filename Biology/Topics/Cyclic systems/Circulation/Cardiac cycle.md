Name for relaxation :: Diastole
<!--SR:!2023-11-30,3,250-->
Name for contraction :: Systole
What does 'diastole' mean? :: 'dilation' (from 'apart' + 'to send', more like 'to send apart')
What does 'systole' mean? :: 'to contract' (from 'together' + 'to send')
What is a rough average for the cardiac duration? :: 0.8 seconds, or 75bpm

What are the names for the steps in a heartbeat? :: Diastole, atrial systole, and ventricular systole

What occurs during diastole? :: Filling with blood due to low pressure; half the time (~0.4 seconds)
<!--SR:!2023-11-30,3,250-->
Atrial systole? :: Ventricles are still relaxed and filling; atria forces are contracted; ~0.1 seconds
<!--SR:!2023-11-28,1,230-->
Ventricular systole? :: Blood is ejected out down to up (the audible heartbeat); atrioventricular valves are closed as a result of ventricle contraction; semilunar valves are open; ~0.3 seconds

What muscles, aside from cardiac, assist with delivering blood? :: Skeletal muscles and breathing muscles

### Valves and stuff
What is the purpose of semilunar valves? :: To keep pressure up 

Where do semilunar valves in the right ventricle lead? :: To the pulmonary artery

### Cycle
**-- Diastole - Dilation --**
Which stage lasts ~0.4 seconds? :: Diastole
How long does diastole last? :: Roughly ~0.4 seconds
<!--SR:!2023-11-30,3,266-->
At what stage is the heart relaxed? :: Diastole
<!--SR:!2023-11-30,3,266-->
At what stage does blood fill the heart? :: Diastole
At what stage are the atrio-ventricular veins open? :: Diastole
<!--SR:!2023-11-28,1,226-->
At what stage are the semilunar valves closed? :: Diastole

In diastole, where does blood from the vena cava go? :: To the right atrium
<!--SR:!2023-11-30,3,250-->
In diastole, where does blood from the pulmonary veins go? :: To the right atrium
What part(s) of the heart are filled during diastole? :: Both the left and right atrium
<!--SR:!2023-11-28,1,230-->
What blood vessel feeds the left atrium? :: The pulmonary vein
What blood vessel feeds the right atrium? :: The vena cava

Which stage comes after diastole? :: Atrial systole
<!--SR:!2023-11-30,3,250-->


**-- Atrial systole - Contraction 1/2 --**
Which stage lasts ~0.1 seconds? :: Atrial systole
How long does atrial systole last? :: Roughly ~0.1 seconds
<!--SR:!2023-11-30,3,250-->
At what stage are the ventricles filled? :: During atrial systole
<!--SR:!2023-11-28,1,230-->
When are the atria contracted? :: During atrial systole
At what stage does deoxygenated blood leave the heart? :: Atrial systole

What is the purpose of the atria contracting during atrial systole? :: Doing so gets more blood into the ventricles
<!--SR:!2023-11-30,3,250-->


**-- Ventricular systole - Contraction 2/2 --**
Which stage lasts ~0.3 seconds? :: Ventricular systole
<!--SR:!2023-11-30,3,250-->
How long does ventricular systole last? :: Roughly ~0.3 seconds
<!--SR:!2023-11-30,3,250-->
At what stage do ventricles contract? :: Ventricular systole (literally 'ventricular contraction')
At what stage do the semilunar valves open? :: Ventricular systole
<!--SR:!2023-11-28,1,230-->
At what stage does oxygenated blood leave the heart? :: Ventricular systole
What is the loudest stage of the cardiac cycle? :: Ventricular systole
<!--SR:!2023-11-30,3,250-->
