? :: Fatty substance that provides a high resistance to current

Purpose :: Allows a high rate of conduction through the axon by insulating it

What [[Neurons|neuron structure]] is closely linked to myelin sheathe? :: The nodes of Ranvier

How are myelin sheathe used in signal conduction? :: They insulate and allow [[Saltatory conduction|saltatory conduction]] to occur

Speed of myelinated conduction :: 
Speed of non-myelinated conduction ::
