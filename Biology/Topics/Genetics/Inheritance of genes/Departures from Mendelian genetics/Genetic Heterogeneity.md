A phenomenon in which a single phenotype or genetic disorder may be caused by any one of a multiple number of alleles or non-allele (locus) mutations 

**Allelic heterogeneity** – different mutations within a single gene locus (forming multiple alleles of that gene) cause the same phenotypic expression
- e.g. 1000 known mutant alleles of the CFTR gene that cause cystic fibrosis 

**Locus heterogeneity** – variations in completely unrelated gene loci cause a single disorder
- e.g. has Ehler’s Danlos syndrome
	- autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked origins
