The probability of a gene or genetic trait being expressed.

**Complete penetrance** – the gene or genes for a trait are expressed in all the population who have the genes 

**Incomplete penetrance** – the genetic trait is expressed in only part of the population

*Penetrance can be difficult to determine reliably*
- e.g. in disease, the onset of symptoms could be age related, or affected by environmental co-determinants such as nutrition and smoking, as well as genetic cofactors
