 A phenomenon whereby the symptoms of a genetic disorder exhibit an earlier age of onset and are more severe as it is passed on to the next generation 
- e.g. Huntington’s disease – trinucleotide repeat disease
	- Children can have so many glutamine repeats that huntington's disease appears in childhood

Why do Triplet repeat mutations get worse over generations*?
1. Slippage of the two complementary DNA strands during replication 
2. Homologous recombination- *every* meiosis event 
3. DNA repair

- Mutation caused by denaturation and misplacement of the strands 
- Mispairing of the complimentary strands In high sequence repeat regions
