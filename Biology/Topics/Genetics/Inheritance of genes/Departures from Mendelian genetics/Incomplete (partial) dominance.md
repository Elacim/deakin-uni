 Both alleles blend their effects  The phenotype of the heterozygote lies somewhere between those of the two kinds of homozygotes 

 The F2 generation shows only one pair of alleles determines the phenotype  However, phenotype ratio is identical to genotype ratio 2:1:1 and not 3:1 like complete dominance

Neither allele is recessive so different symbols are used
