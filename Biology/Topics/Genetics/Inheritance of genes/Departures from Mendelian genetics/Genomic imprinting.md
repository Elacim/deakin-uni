- Normally there is no difference of expression of the paternal and maternal alleles
- Genomic imprinting causes selective expression of a gene or genes inherited from one parent
- Not a mutation or permanent change
- Plays a role in several genetic disorders
	- e.g. The same region of chromosome 15 mutated but causes a different disease if inherited from mother or father
	- Prader-Willi syndrome: Paternal copy
	- Angelman syndrome: Maternal copy
