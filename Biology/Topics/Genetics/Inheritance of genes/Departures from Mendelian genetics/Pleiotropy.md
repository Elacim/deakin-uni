- Occurs when one gene influences multiple phenotypic traits
- The gene codes for a product that is, for example, used by various cells, or has a signalling function on various targets

ToF: MOST genes work this way :: True.

a mutation in a pleiotropic gene may have an effect on some or all traits simultaneously

#### Phenylalanine example
Phenylketonuria (PKU)
- Caused by any of over 400 mutations in a single gene that codes for the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which converts the amino acid phenylalanine to tyrosine


Symptoms include 
- intellectual impairment
- reduced hair and skin pigmentation
- microcephalic
- eczema
- musty smell.

### Antagonistic pleiotropy
Antagonistic pleiotropy
- The expression of a gene resulting in multiple competing effects, some beneficial but others detrimental to the organism
- Theory of aging (G. C. Williams, 1957) 
	- Some genes responsible for increased fitness in the younger, fertile organism contribute to decreased fitness later in life
	- e.g. BRCA2 gene, women with mutations are more fertile but after reproduction the gene causes cancer (commonly breast cancer)
