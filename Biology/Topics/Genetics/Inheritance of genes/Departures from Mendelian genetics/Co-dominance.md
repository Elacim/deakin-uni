 Both alleles show their effects – DO NOT blend  In codominance, neither allele are dominant; both are expressed. A cross between organisms with two different phenotypes produces offspring with has both phenotypes of the parental traits shown

### Genetic basis
In blood: In humans, two forms of a glycoprotein exist on the surface of red blood cells – designated M and N
Someone may exhibit one or both.
