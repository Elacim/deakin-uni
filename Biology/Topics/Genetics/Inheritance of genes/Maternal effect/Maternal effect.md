? :: Factors in the cytoplasm (released by the nuclear genes of the female) can have specific effects on the developing embryo

How are these factors 'obtained'?
?
The female **cytoplasm** contributes the mitochondria for all animal species (and chloroplasts for plants).
On meiosis, 

The maternal genotype has a strong influence during early development • The embryo is formed when a female gamete unites with a male gamete • Female gamete provides the cytoplasm for the developing embryo

 
 • These two organelles contain DNA and control certain traits in the offspring. 

1. Phenotypes controlled by organelle genes exhibit maternal inheritance 
2. Phenotypes that are controlled by nuclear factors found in the cytoplasm of the female are said to express a maternal effect- not dependent on genotype


# Limnaea snails
The classic phenotype which exhibits maternal effects is coiling direction of snail shells. The coiling phenotype that is seen in the offspring is controlled by the genotype of the mother.

D allele (dextral) causes right-handed coil. (Dd & Dd **females** store the D gene product in oocytes (eggs))
d allele (sinistral) causes left-handed and is mutant, coding for an inactive gene product.

Gen III is all dextral because the egg from the previous generation has `Dd`. That genotype trumps the child's genotype.

Gen IV is more mendelian. The sinistral snails (`dd`) on the right-hand sides cannot produce the `D` gene product and therefore cannot pass it on to it's oocytes. What happened to it's mum's cytoplasm? I guess we can assume it has no effect, or perhaps is diluted by the time egg production occurs.


- Spindle orientation determined in the first cleavage division after fertilization determines the direction of the coiling
- Maternal genes act on the developing eggs in the ovary – affecting spindle orientation
- Ooplasm from dextral eggs injected into uncleaved sinistral eggs result in cleavage in a dextral pattern
- Ooplasm from sinistral eggs injected into uncleaved dextral eggs result in cleavage in a dextral pattern
Even if the oocyte contains only the d allele following meiosis and is fertilized by a d- bearing sperm, the resulting dd snail will be dextrally coiled (right handed) because the cytoplasm has the allele floating about in it.
