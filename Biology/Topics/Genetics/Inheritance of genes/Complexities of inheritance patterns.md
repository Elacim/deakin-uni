 **Variations in gene expression** 
 - affect pedigree analysis and assignment of genotypes to members of the pedigree
 - Genotypes can be masked because of:
	 - Factors can affect gene expression
		 - Interactions with other genes in the genotype
		 - Interactions between genes and the environment


**Age-related phenotypic expression**
- Huntington disease
	- An autosomal dominant disorder associated with progressive neural degeneration and dementia
		- Brain collapses in on itself
	- Often appears in the 40s
	- Adult onset is followed by death in 10 to 15 years
- Porphyria
	- An autosomal dominant disorder that leads to intermittent attacks of pain and dementia
	- Symptoms first appear in adulthood


**Two aspects of phenotypic variation**
- [[Penetrance]]
	- The probability that a disease phenotype will appear when a disease-related genotype is present
- Expressivity
	- The range of phenotypic variation associated with a given phenotype

Incomplete penetrance pedigree for camptodactyly (immobile, bent, and little fingers)
-> Dominant trait with variable expression and incomplete penetrance
This pedigree with it's half-circles specifically shows a person *with* the disease rather than the typical half-circle representing carriers.
