### Ethical Questions
Why would an individual not want to find out if they have have a chance of having a genetic disorder/disease through testing?
?
- They may find it depressing/anxiety-inducing/stressful to know
- The results do not guarantee it will show up
- Genetic discrimination from employers/insurance; 

### Sickle-Cell Anaemia
What is sickle-cell anaemia caused by? :: A single amino acid substitution within haemoglobin
Is sickle-cell anaemia dominant or recessive? :: Recessive.
How are sickle-cells created? :: When there is low oxygen content, the haemoglobin aggregates into long fibres, curving the red blood cell into a sickle shape
How are sickle-cell anaemia symptoms triggered? :: They are triggered when the individual has a low oxygen count which causes the sickle-cells to clump and clog small blood vessels (especially capillaries)
Sickle-Cell Anaemia symptoms :: Weakness, organ damage, fevers, pain, and anaemia
True or False: Only sickle-cell homozygous individuals display symptoms. :: False. Heterozygous can too, but only when oxygen is low for a long period of time. 
Do individuals heterozygous for sickle-cell display symptoms? :: Yes, but only when they have a prolonged low blood oxygen count 

### Huntington's Disease
Is Huntington's Disease recessive or dominant? :: Dominant.
When do symptoms show? :: With a range of 35-45 years, well within chance of the individual already reproducing
What are the effects of Huntington's Disease? :: Gradual nervous system deterioration 
Is Huntington's Disease curable? :: No, it is irreversible and always fatal
[[Trinucleotide repeat diseases]]

### Misc. Diseases
What is Phenylketonuria? :: The inability to metabolise phenylalanine
How is Phenylketonuria treated? :: Since it is genetic, it can not be, but a carefully managed diet can let the individual live a relatively normal life
### Misc. questions 
Are lethal recessive or lethal dominant alleles more likely? Why? :: Lethal recessive alleles are more likely, perhaps due to it being able to proliferate throughout generations with plenty of carriers being born with an allele for the trait. A lethal dominant allele would likely kill off the individual and therefore be unable to proliferate. 
True or False: A lethal dominant allele is 

How would a lethal dominant allele be passed on? :: If individual does not display symptoms until after they have reproduced, then there is a chance they passed on the allele
