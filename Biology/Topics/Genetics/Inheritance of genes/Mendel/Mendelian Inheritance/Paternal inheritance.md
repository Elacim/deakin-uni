100 paternal mitochondria enter the egg (containing 100,000 maternal mt) but are actively targeted and destroyed by a mechanism that recognizes the **ubiquitin** that sperm are tagged with

Situations exist in which the mechanism for recognition of paternal mitochondria in the fertilized egg can fail, thus enabling PATERNAL LEAKAGE to occur
- Paternal leakage has been observed in a taxonomically wide variety of invertebrate and vertebrate species
