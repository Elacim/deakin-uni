Character ::: A heritable feature that varies among individuals, such as flower colour
Trait ::: Each variant for a character, such as purple or white colour for flowers - the observable phenotype
Allele :: Variants of a gene; specifiers of traits

Genotype ::: An organism's genetic makeup (e.g. `Pp & PP`)
<!--SR:!2024-07-13,3,250!2000-01-01,1,250-->
Genotypic ratio :: The ratio of differing alleles (e.g. `1PP : 2Pp : 1pp`)
Phenotype ::: An organism's observable appearance and/or observable/physiological traits (e.g. `Pp & PP` making two purple plants)
Phenotypic ratio :: The ratio of the tabulating the end result of differing alleles (e.g. `2 purple : 1 white`, got from the genotypic ratio `1PP : 2Pp : 1pp`)

True/pure breeding (pure breed) organism :: An organism that is homozygous for an allele, and where the alleles will propagate throughout generations (i.e. self-fertilisation will always result in the same alleles)
Hybridisation :: The breeding of two true breeding organisms (e.g. `PP x pp`) to create a hybrid (`Pp`)

Polygenic :: One characteristic is controlled by two or more genes

[[Law of Segregation]]

Homozygous ::: Two identical alleles encoding a character across two different chromosomes 
Homozygote ::: An organism that is homozygous for a character
Heterozygous ::: Two differing alleles encoding a character across two different chromosomes
Heterozygote ::: An organism that is heterozygous for a character

Locus :: The specific position on a chromosome where a gene is located

[[Law of Independent Assortment]]
