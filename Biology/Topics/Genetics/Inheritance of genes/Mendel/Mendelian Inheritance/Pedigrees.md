Proband :: First person to display a disease


# Types
### Recessive
- Must be recessive if there are two unaffected parents as there must be an affected parent to be dominant
	- One or both the parents are therefore carriers

### Figuring out a pedigree

- If both parents express the trait, then all their offspring should also express the trait
- If the offspring express the trait but their parents don't, then both parents are heterozygous
- If the offspring does not express the trait and one parent does, the offspring is heterozygous
###### Determine recessiveness or dominance
A parent **must** have a given trait to be dominant
If the parent does not have a trait but the child does (i.e. a generation is skipped), this must mean the trait is recessive
###### Determine if it's autosomal or sex-linked
Autosomal traits affect males and females in equal proportions while X-linked tend to affect males more than females

Fathers never share their X chromosome with sons, only daughters.
