######  Autosomal recessive
- Any affected founding **daughter** with two unaffected parents...
	- An affected individual must inherit a recessive allele from both parents (like `rr`)
- ...OR, an affected founding **son** has two unaffected parents AND both parents are unaffected carriers (otherwise, it's [[#X-Linked recessive]]) 
- If the father had of had a recessive X-Linked allele, he would have been affected



Characteristics of autosomal recessive traits
- For rare traits, most affected individuals have unaffected parents
- All children of affected parents are affected
- The risk of an affected child with heterozygous parents is 25%

 Most affected individuals have unaffected parents
- About Â¼ children in large affected families show the trait
- Both sexes affected in approximately equal numbers
- Affected parents have only affected children
