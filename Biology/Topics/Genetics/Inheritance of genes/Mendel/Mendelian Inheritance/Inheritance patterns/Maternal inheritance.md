 Mitochondria 
- Cytoplasmic organelles that convert energy from food into ATP (ATP powers cellular functions) 
- Carry DNA for 37 mitochondrial genes
- Genetic disorders in mitochondrial DNA are associated with defects in energy conversion

- The egg provides all the mitochondria to the zygote. The sperm does not pass on any mitochondria
	- Sperm mitochondria, with few exceptions, is recycled
- Hence we all have our mother’s mitochondrial DNA
	- All siblings, male and female, in a family will have the same mitochondrial DNA
	- Used in forensic science to establish identities



![[Maternal inheritance (mitochondria).png]]
- Mitochondria (and genetic disorders caused by mutations in mitochondrial genes) are maternally inherited
- Both males and females can be affected, but *only affected females* pass on the trait.
In this pedigree, the ***unique* mitochondrial genotypes** are
I: 1 and 2
II: 2, 4, 6, and 8
III: -
