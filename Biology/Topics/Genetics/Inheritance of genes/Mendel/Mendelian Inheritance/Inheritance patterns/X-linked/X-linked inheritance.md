X-linked  Pattern of inheritance that results from genes located on the X chromosome


#### X-Linked recessive
- An affected non-founding son with unaffected parents
	- A male can be affected by a single X-Linked recessive allele
		- But cannot be affected by a single autosomal allele
- May be where the son must have inherited the allele from only his mother and potentially unaffected father

 Affected males receive the mutant allele from their mother and transmit it to all of their daughters, but not to their sons  Daughters of affected males are usually heterozygous  Sons of heterozygous females have a 50% chance of being affected
 
![[X-linked inheritance - Recessive pedigree.png]] Hemizygous males are affected and transmit the mutant allele to all their daughters who become carriers  Phenotypic expression much more common in males
-> Hemizygous refers to sex chromosomes. It is equivalent to heterozygous.

 X-linked recessive traits affect males more than females because males are hemizygous for genes on the X chromosome  A gene present on the X chromosome that is expressed in males in both the recessive and dominant condition  Or a gene present only in one copy in a diploid organism, e.g. most of the X chromosome genes in a male human.
