- Genes on sex chromosomes have a distinct pattern of inheritance
- Males pass an X chromosome to all of their daughters but none of their sons
- Females pass an X chromosome to all of their children
- Most genes on the X chromosome are not on the Y chromosome

Y chromosome mostly contains male-related genes (encoding for testes, etc. )
 Y-linked  Pattern of inheritance that results from genes located only on the Y chromosome
