- Every child is affected from non-founding parents
- A child can not be affected by a sole autosomal recessive allele

 Characteristics of autosomal dominant traits
- Every affected individual has at least one affected parent (except in traits with high mutation rates or incomplete penetrance)
- If an affected individual is heterozygous and has an unaffected mate, each child has a 50% chance of being affected
- Two affected individuals can have an unaffected child

 Affected individuals have at least one affected parent
- About ½ of children of an affected parent are affected
- Both sexes equally affected
- Affected parents can have an unaffected child
