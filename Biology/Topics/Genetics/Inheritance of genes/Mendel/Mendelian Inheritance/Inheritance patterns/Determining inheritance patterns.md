- [[Inheritance patterns]]

**Step 1:** Is it dominant or recessive?
- Does it skip generations? -> Recessive

**Step 2:** Autosomal or [[Sex-linked inheritance]]
- Father to son? -> Likely autosomal
If it's always father to daughter -> Likely X-linked dominant

**Step 3:** [[Y-linked]]
- Only males affected
- No skipping
If both, it's likely Y-linked

**Step 4:** [[Maternal inheritance]]
- Starts from mum
- Not passed by males
- All children affected
