What are alleles? :: Variations in a gene's nucleotide sequence
What do dominant alleles do to recessive alleles? :: Nothing, they are simply seen in the phenotype
How do dominant alleles and recessive alleles interact, say in a heterozygote? :: They do not interact

When a dominant allele coexists with a recessive allele in a heterozygote, they do not actually interact at all. It is in the pathway from genotype to phenotype that dominance and recessiveness come into play.

### Complete dominance
Complete dominance :: Dominant allele is completely dominant over the recessive allele, i.e. if one dominant allele appears, the trait will always appear as that dominant allele

### Incomplete/weak dominance
Incomplete dominance :: Blending of traits (e.g. `M x N = O` or `Pp x Pp = light purple`) - when the phenotype of $F_{1}$ hybrids is somewhere between the phenotypes of the two parental varieties, such as red and white flowers mixing to become pink

Incomplete dominance examples
?
- Hypercholesterolemia - high cholesterol due to a lack of low density lipoproteins (LDLs) - `HH` = homozygous **ability** to make LDL receptors; `Hh` - mild disease; `hh` = homozygous **inability** to make LDL receptors
- Snapdragons, where neither allele (red + white) is particularly dominant, so they sort of blend to form pink

### Co-dominance
Co-dominance :: The heterozygote has a phenotype with both parental strains (e.g. `M x N = MN`)

What would happen if two dominant red and white flower colour alleles mixed? :: Both would show up, perhaps as white with red spots

Co-dominance examples
?
MN blood groups - both are present in heterozygous individuals
	$L^{m}L^{m}$ = m compound present on red blood cells
	$L^{m}L^{n}$ = m and n compound present on red blood cells
	$L^{n}L^{n}$ = n compound present on red blood cells
What are $L^{m}$ and $L^{n}$ examples of? :: MN blood groups (co-dominance)
