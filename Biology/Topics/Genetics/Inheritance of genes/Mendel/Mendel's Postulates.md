1. Hereditary factors (aka genes) exist in pairs
2. Traits can be present but not expressed (dominant vs. recessive)
3. Each parent contributes only one of their factors to each offspring - the [[Law of Segregation]]
4. During gamete formation, segregating pairs or unit factors sort independently - the [[Law of Independent Assortment]]
