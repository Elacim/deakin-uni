If two events are mutually exclusive:
$p(C$ $\ce{or}$ $D) = p(C) + p(D)$
The probability that at least one of them occurs, is the sum of their individual probabilities

- Rolling a three $\ce{OR}$ a two on one dice
	- $\frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$
- Picking a six $\ce{OR}$ a two out of a deck of cards
	- $\frac{4}{52} + \frac{4}{52} = \frac{2}{13}$

- Probability of `AaBbCc x AaBBCC` giving `AABbCc` or `AABBCC`
	- `AABbCc` $\frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{16}$
	- `AABBCC` $\frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{16}$
	- $\frac{1}{16} + \frac{1}{16} = \frac{2}{16} = \frac{1}{8}$
