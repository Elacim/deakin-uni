#### When to use the multiplicative vs. additive rules
The [[Multiplicative law (Product law)|multiplicative law]] is used when:
- The events are statistically independent
- You want multiple things to be true 
	- e.g. `AaBb x AaBb` probability that we get `AA` and `BB`, `AABB

The [[Additive rule (sum law)|additive law]] is used when:
- The events are mutually exclusive 
- You want to know the probability of one or more of multiple events being true
	- e.g. `AaBb x AaBb` probability that we get `AA` or `BB`
