? :: A form of gene interaction in which one gene masks the phenotypic expression of another

Difference: dominant/recessive is between alleles of the same gene

- There are no new phenotypes produced by this type of gene interaction
 
- The alleles that are masking the effect are called epistatic alleles
- The alleles whose effect is being altered or suppressed are called the hypostatic alleles*

Was Mendel just wrong? 
No, none of these cases has violated the principles of segregation and independent assortment - just added complexity

#### Mouse example
 If individual is cc, then is albino regardless of allele at b locus - due to gene interaction  Normally two gene (dihybrid) crosses would produce a 9:3:3:1 ratio  Due to gene interaction, we see a 9:3:4 F2 ratio. The c locus is epistatic to the b locus.  cc masks the b locus
