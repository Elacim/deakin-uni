Lethal alleles  Mutations occur giving rise to new forms of alleles  Some of these are lethal mutations  A dominant lethal is an allele that causes death of the organism that contains it, whether homozygous or heterozygous for the allele  A recessive lethal is an allele that that causes death when homozygous  In the heterozygote, a lethal allele is masked by the presence of an allele for ‘wild type’


##### Dominant
- Dominant lethal genes are rarely detected due to their rapid elimination from populations 
**How could dominant genes be maintained in populations?**
- Huntington’s disease – a neurological disorder in humans, which reduces life expectancy
- Because the onset of Huntington's disease is slow, individuals carrying the allele can pass it on to their offspring
[[Trinucleotide repeat diseases]]

##### Recessive
- Manx cats are heterozygous for a dominant mutation that results in no tails
- A cross between two Manx cats produces a 2:1 phenotype ratio (tailless to tailed) instead of the normal 3:1 phenotype ratio
	- `Tt x Tt` results in `TT, Tt, Tt, and tt`
	- `TT` are normal
	- `Tt` are Manx
	- `tt`, recessive homozygotes do not survive
		- Spinal defects in Manx cats are much worse when `tt`, resulting in death
