 Some traits are controlled by two or more genes  Phenotypes can be discontinuous or continuous  Discontinuous variation shows distinct (discrete) phenotypes  E.g. Pea plant colour, ABO blood group

##### Continuous variation
- shows a series of overlapping phenotypic classes 
	- e.g. Height, weight, hand span, shoe size, milk yield in cows
