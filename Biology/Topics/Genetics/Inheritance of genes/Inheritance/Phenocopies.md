A phenocopy is an individual whose phenotype under a particular environmental condition, is identical to the one of another individual whose phenotype is determined by the genotype
- The phenocopy environmental condition mimics the phenotype produced by a gene (i.e. black coat)

Gene C controls fur pigmentation in Himalayan rabbits. Because
the gene is active when environmental temperatures are between
15 and 250C, the rabbit reared at 20C (left) has pigmentation on
its ears, nose, and feet, where its body loses the most heat The
rabbit reared at temperatures above 300C (right) has no fur
pigmentation, because gene C is inactive at these higher
temperatures-
