**Germline mosaicism** – a special form of mosaicism, where some gametes (sperm or oocytes) carry a mutation, but the rest are normal 
- Cause is usually a mutation that occurred in an early stem cell that gave rise to the gonadal tissue
This can cause only some offspring to be affected, even for a dominant disease
