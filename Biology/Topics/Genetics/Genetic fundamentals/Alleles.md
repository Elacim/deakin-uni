Other forms of a gene.

**What are alleles in regards to DNA?**
?
Variations in the nucleotide sequence at the same locus of a gene, being single point to large sequence changes

**Etymology**
?
Allele is short for allelomorph meaning *other form* (of a gene).
Allelomorph derives from the Greek prefix *-allel* meaning *one another* and *morphÄ“* meaning *form*: *another form*

**Do allele changes/mutations always result in phenotypic changes?**
?
No. They're often either negligible or only observable in the genotype.
