 Loss of (cell) function mutations – impedes function
- Null mutations – completely abrogates function
- Gain of function mutations – change function (new unique function)
- Most loss of function mutations are recessive (haplosufficiency). Some however can be dominant (haploinsufficiency).
- Lethal mutation – embryonic or in mature organism - Huntington’s is lethal to adults
