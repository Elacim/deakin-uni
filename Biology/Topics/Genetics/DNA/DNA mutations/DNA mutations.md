Mutations can become heritable changes and the source of genetic variation

Germ-line vs. somatic mutation
![[DNA mutations - Germ line vs somatic mutation.png|200]]

ï‚— Spontaneous mutation occurs naturally (a normal mistake rate)
- One in every million to one in every billion divisions-
- Newborn human baby will have on average 60 new mutations when compared to parents (90% in noncoding regions).
Induced mutation caused by mutagens
- Substances that cause a much higher rate of mutation
