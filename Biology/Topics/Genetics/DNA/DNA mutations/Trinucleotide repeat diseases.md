ï‚— Genetic diseases characterised by presence of unstable and abnormal expansions of DNA- triplets (trinucleotides)
- E.g. CAG CAG CAG CAG
- E.g. CGG CGG CGG CGG
- The repeat may inactivate a gene or result in a toxic protein (e.g. Huntington disease)
- Generally show genetic anticipation, where their severity increases with each successive generation that inherits them.
