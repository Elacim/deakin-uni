Pronounciation :: 'Aims'

 Developed by Bruce Ames and his colleagues in the 1970s
- Tests the mutagenicity of different compounds
- Is used by FDA to test many chemicals rapidly and inexpensively
- Uses special bacteria that are very sensitive to many mutagenic agents
- More than 60 cancer-causing compounds found in cig



 Characteristics of mutants strains of Salmonella typhimurium used for Ames Test 
1. Cannot synthesise amino acid histidine (auxotroph, requires histidine in medium) 
2. Very susceptible to additional mutations because they lack the normal repair mechanisms found in bacteria 
3. More permeable than wild-type bacteria to external chemicals, including potential mutagens



 Mutant strains are unable to synthesise histidine (his-)
- Require histidine to grow
- The assay measures the frequency of reverse mutations occurring in the mutant gene, yielding wild-type bacteria (his+ revertants)
