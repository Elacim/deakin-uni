 CFTR gene is mutated in cystic fibrosis  Many mutations reported but some mutations affect function of protein (ion channel; fluid homeostasis) more severely than others  Most common mutation is ΔF508 (F=Phenylalanine)

 CFTR = cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator  R117 and R334 mutants are partially active and result in a mild disease.  Δ F508 causes a severe disease as the protein is inactive

**Treatments**
- Kalideco: opens the jammed protein (in trials 2007) - 
- Orkambi treatment: combination therapy of Lumafactor & Ivafactor to open door and stabilize protein (in trials 2013)
