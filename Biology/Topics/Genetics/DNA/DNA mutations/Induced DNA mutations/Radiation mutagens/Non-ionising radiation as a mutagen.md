**What is non-ionising radiation?** :: Electromagnetic radiation that does not carry enough energy to remove an electron from a molecule

**Does non-ionising radiation have a biological effect?** :: Yes, and it depends on the type of of non-ionizing radiation

**Can non-ionising ultraviolet damage DNA?** :: Yes. UV-B can directly induce [[Pyrimidine dimers]] and double-strand DNA breaks
