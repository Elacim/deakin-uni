![[Intercalating agents found in DNA.png|300]]

**?** :: Agent of an appropriate size and chemical nature fits in between base pairs of DNA.

**Meaning** :: *to insert between others*, or more literally *insertion of an intercalary day* in regards to the annual fixing of Roman calendars

#### Problems
**What do these agents do to DNA?** :: They lodge themselves into DNA, disrupting base pair connections

**Main problems with these agents**
?
- DNA *must* unwind to accommodate agent
	- causes the base pairs to separate
		- Inhibition of transcription and/or replication
		- Prevents repair
	- can cause frameshifts

**How do these agents affect the [[DNA repair]] process?** :: They can often completely inhibit repair enzymes

#### Helpfulness (to scientists)
**How can these be used to help scientists?** :: They make good nucleic acid stains 

**Most commonly used intercalating agent for sciencing** :: *ethidium bromide* (*EtBr*)
