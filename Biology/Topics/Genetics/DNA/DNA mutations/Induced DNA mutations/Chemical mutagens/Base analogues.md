**?** :: Similar structure to nucleotide bases causing accidental incorporation into DNA

**Main effect** :: Cause mispairing during DNA replication leading to mutations

Difference between thymine and *5-Bromouracil* :: Thymine has a methyl group

**What nucleotide counterpart does *5-Bromouracil* bond to?** :: Though it resembles thymine, it will bond to guanine.

**How would *5-Bromouracil* affect DNA replication?**
?
1. 5-BrU is incorporated in place of a Thymine (let's say left-side)
2. On replication the template...
	1. right strand all bonds appropriately 
	2. left strand does too, except the 5-BrU which bonds to a Guanine
3. On further replications, the template....
	1. right strand is now Guanine instead of Adenine 
	2. this 5-BrU will remain and continue to bond G 

5-bromouracil resembles thymine and will be incorporated into DNA, but it pairs with G rather than A, leading to a mutation (AT to GC)
