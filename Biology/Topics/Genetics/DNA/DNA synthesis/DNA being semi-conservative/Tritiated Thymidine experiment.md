Evidence for semiconservative replication of eukaryotic chromosomes
- Labelling of DNA in beans shoots with tritiated thymidine
- The labelled DNA strands in the chromosomes is detected by autoradiography

The second round of DNA replication was carried out without the radioactive isotope so the new strands are not labelled.
- Note that only one of each chromatid is labelled, as predicted from the semiconservative replication model. After synthesis: the second metaphase â€“ nice and condensed
