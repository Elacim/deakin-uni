• 15N is a heavy isotope of Nitrogen • Why nitrogen? • DNA containing 15N can be distinguished from 14N using sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation • Samples are forced by centrifugation through a gradient of heavy metal salt: cesium chloride • DNA reaches equilibrium when their density = the density of the gradient medium • 15N will reach this point closer to the bottom of the tube than 14N

In generation 0: clear band of N15-N15.
Gen1: Two bands of N14-N15
etc.
