- [[DNA Replication]]


##### Prokaryotes
 RNA primers shorter (10 nucleotides)
- Okazaki fragments are longer
- Continuous DNA synthesis
 One origin of replication 2 replication forks
- An E. coli cell contains about 15 molecules of Pol III
- No nucleosomes
- Circular chromosome

##### Eukaryotes
 RNA primers longer (10-60 nucleotides)
- Okazaki fragments are shorter
- DNA synthesis only in S-phase

 Multiple origins of replication and forks
- Multiple polymerases and different pol replicate the leading/lagging strands:
- DNA polymerase $\alpha$ (alpha)*
- DNA polymerase $\delta$ (delta)
- Telomerase completes the synthesis of linear chromosomes
