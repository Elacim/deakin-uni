DNA helicase (DnaB protein)
![[DNA Unwinding using DNA helicase (DnaB protein).png]]

**Topoisomerase**
 DNA must be cut to allow it to be unwound and rotate during synthesis  DNA topoisomerases (also called gyrase)  Topoisomerase I puts a single stranded break (phosphodiester bonds) in DNA ahead of the replication fork  This allows the DNA to swivel as it is unwound https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4fbPUGKurI
