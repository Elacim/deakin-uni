Here is a replication fork in an E. Coli. It goes right to left.

ï‚— The point at which the DNA is being replicated
- The replication fork can be visualised by labelling replicating DNA with tritiated thymidine and autoradiography
- This was first carried out with E. coli by John Cairns
- E. coli was a good model: has a small circular chromosome, easy to purify
