ï‚— DNA polymerase starts copying DNA at unique points called origins of replication
- The E. coli chromosome has only one origin called OriC
- Origin of replications are often AT rich, because the double helix is more easily melted*
- Human chromosomes have many origins of replication- we have more chromosomes must be replicated quickly..

![[Origins of replication in OriC.png]]
OriC is 245 nucleotides long and has two different repeat elements, the three 13-mer repeats are AT-rich.

Left: AT rich region, forms a replication bubble, a localised region of strand separation

9-mer initiation site: Binding site for a protein that forms the replication bubble. DnaA is a protein that activates initiation of DNA replication in bacteria. It is a replication initiation factor which promotes the unwinding of DNA at oriC.
