**What is a polymerase?** :: A family of enzymes that catalyse DNA synthesis using a template DNA/RNA

**What do polymerases (generally) do during DNA synthesis?** :: Catalyse the addition of 5' dNTPs to 3'-OH
[[Nucleosides]]

- All DNA polymerases catalyse the addition of deoxyribonucleotide 5â€™-triphosphates (abbreviated dNTPs) to the 3'-OH of the growing chain
- As the name suggests dNTPs contain 3 phosphates
- DNA synthesis proceeds in the 5' to 3' direction
	- Polymerases only work this way


DNA polymerases IV and V are minor repair enzymes

exonuclease 

##### Rules
1. Polymerisation occurs only 5' to 3'
2. Polymerisation requires a template to copy: the complementary strand.
3. Polymerisation requires 4 dNTPs: dATP, dGTP, dCTP, dTTP
4. Polymerisation requires a pre-existing primer from which to extend
	- The primer is RNA in most organisms
	- [[Telomere shortening]]
