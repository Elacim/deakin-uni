DNA synthesis must start with a primer  Chain synthesis by DNA polymerases must start from a short oligonucleotide RNA primer (10 to 12 nucleotides long in E.coli)  DNA polymerase adds a dNTP to the 3'-OH of the primer, directed by complementary base pairing with the strand to be copied  the template strand is the strand that is copied

![[Purpose of primers.png]]Think of it this way: a new sugar phosphate backbone with attached complementary bases needs to be built in the daughter strand. The RNA primers job is to kick this off and provide the attachment sites for the growing chain
