- [[Polymerase III]]


 Maintains the fidelity of DNA replication
- The DNA polymerases have a proof reading ability that remove mismatched bases
- Proof reading is one function of the exonuclease activity of the polymerases
- This activity is built into the monomeric DNA polymerase I, but is carried out by the ε-subunit of DNA polymerase III
- 6 billion bases that are replicated in human cells during DNA replication. Error rate of 1 in 10 billion.

Uses the 3’ – 5’ exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase
