 First DNA polymerase isolated
- This enzyme has three activities: 5’ 3’ polymerase activity 5’ 3’ exonuclease activity 3’ 5’ exonuclease activity
- Note that an exonuclease is an enzyme which digests nucleic acids (in this case DNA) from one end

 DNA polymerase I is not the enzyme that replicates DNA
- Evidence for this: E. coli mutants lacking DNA polymerase I can still replicate DNA
DNA polymerase I is required for DNA repair, proof reading and removal of RNA primers
- Mutants with defective polymerase I are very sensitive to UV light
- No proofreading - accumulating mutations
