- [[Telomeres]]

 Why don’t we have telomerase in our somatic cells?
Because the cells would be able to divide continuously…

If telomeres always shorten as a cell divides, and the cell dies if the telomere gets too short, how can a cancer cell live forever and continually divide?
- Cancer cells up-regulate telomerase, which can prevent telomeres from getting shorter and even elongate them
- Telomerase is activated in approximately 90% of tumours
