 The telomere DNA sequences of a variety of eukaryotes are largely conserved, consisting of repeats of a simple-sequence DNA containing clusters of G residues on one strand  E.g. the sequence of telomere repeats in humans and other mammals is AGGGTT, in Tetrahymena (a protozoan) it is GGGGTT, in Arabidopsis (a plant) it is AGGGTTT


 These sequences are repeated hundreds or thousands of times,  Spanning up to several kilobases,  Terminate with an overhang of single-stranded DNA Telomere DNA loops back on itself to form a circular structure that protects the ends of chromosomes- chromosomes are sealed at the ends
