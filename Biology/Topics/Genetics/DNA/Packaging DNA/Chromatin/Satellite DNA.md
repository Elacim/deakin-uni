? :: Tandem-repeats (TRs) of non-coding DNA

**Why the name?**
?
Satellite refers to a small unit (tandem-repeats) that is a part of a big structure (DNA) 


**How was satellite DNA found?**
?
Satellite DNA have different AT and GC pairing frequencies than the rest of the DNA. 
When processed through centrifuge, these differences tend to shows up as distinct bands due to the differing densities of AT and GC.

Are AT pairings denser than GC pairings? :: No, GC pairings are denser.

#### Different satellite families, base pairs per repeat, and their locations

| Satellite family       | bp/unit | Location in human chromosomes                                        | Purpose                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| $\alpha$ (alphoid DNA) | 171     | All chromosomes                                                      | [[Centromere#Type II large centromeres]] |
| $\beta$                | 68      | Centromeres of chromosomes 1, 9, 13, 14, 15, 21, 22, and Y           |                                          |
| Satellite 1            | 25-48   | Centromeres and other regions in heterochromatin of most chromosomes |                                          |
| Satellite 2            | 5       | Most chromosomes                                                     |                                          |
| Satellite 3            | 5       | Most chromosomes                                                     |                                          |
