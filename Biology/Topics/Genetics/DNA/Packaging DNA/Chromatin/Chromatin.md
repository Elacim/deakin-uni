? :: The combination of DNA and proteins that make up the contents of the nucleus of a cell

Packaging levels in chromosomes influences activity and differs by region
Primary protein components of chromatin :: [[Histones]] that compact the DNA

Types of chromatin :: Euchromatin and heterochromatin

**Euchromatin** ::: The less condensed form of chromatin available for transcription; stains light
**Heterochromatin** ::: The highly condensed form of chromatin that appears during interphase, and is generally not transcribed; stains dark


**Primary functions of chromatin**
?
1. To package DNA into a smaller volume to fit in the cell 
2. To strengthen the DNA to allow mitosis and meiosis and prevent DNA damage (strengthen during anaphase separation â€“ spindle force) 
3. To control gene expression and DNA replication
