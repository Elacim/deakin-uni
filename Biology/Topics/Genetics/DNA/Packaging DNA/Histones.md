Abundant molecules
Histone protein sequence is highly conserved among eukaryotes — conserved function
- Provide the first level of packaging for DNA
- Compact the DNA by a factor of approximately 7
- Rich in Lysine and Arginine 


**Charge** :: +ve charged
**Acidity** :: Alkaline
Advantage of histone positive charge :: It attracts DNA

 5 main types: H2A, H2B, H3, H4, and H1
H1? — attached to the nucleosome and involved in further packaging of the DNA (conversion of 10 nm chromatin to 30 nm chromatin)
- The histone structure produces a 10nm "beads- on-a-string" fibre
