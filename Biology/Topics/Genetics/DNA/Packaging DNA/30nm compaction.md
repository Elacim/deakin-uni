- DNA is further packaged when the DNA nucleosomes associate with one another to produce 30nm chromatin
- Mechanism of packaging is not understood, but H1 plays a role (if H1 is absent, then chromatin cannot be converted from 10 to 30 nm)
- DNA is condensed to 1/6th its unfolded size, 30nm heterochromatin
