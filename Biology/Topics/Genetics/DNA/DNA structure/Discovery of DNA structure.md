When and by who was DNA first discovered? :: In 1951, by Rosalind Franklin
What is 'image 51'? :: A picture of the diffraction of X-rays on DNA, implying DNA being a double-stranded helix
- The data indicated that DNA was a highly ordered two stranded structure
- A repeating substructure every 0.34 nanometers (base stack), ‘between each base’

 Watson realized Chargaff’s data indicated a very specific relationship between the bases  Crick proposed that the base pairing could be accommodated in a double helix with antiparallel strands and internal bases
