How often does a turn occur? :: Every 10 bases

Where does the prime (') naming come from? :: The ribose carbon atoms, with 1' being clockwise to the oxygen

Base (AT/CG) location :: 1'
Phosphate group location :: 5’ end
OH group location :: 3’ end

**At what end (3'/5') do new nucleotides connect to?** :: The phosphate group (5') of the new attaches to the OH (3') of the old



Polynucleotides are DIRECTIONAL
- Nucleotides are joined together to form a polynucleotide chain
- Polynucleotide chains have slightly different structures at either end

DNA is a double helix of two polynucleotides held together by hydrogen bonds
- The two strands run in different directions
	- 3' to 5'
	- 5' to 3'
