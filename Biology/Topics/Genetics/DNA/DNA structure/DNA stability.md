ï‚— The stability of the helix is due to:
- Large number of hydrogen bonds
- GC rich DNA is more stable than AT-rich DNA because the GC base pair has three hydrogen bonds
- Hydrophobic bonding (base stacking) between bases- trying to force water out
- Hydrogen bonds between bases and water molecules
