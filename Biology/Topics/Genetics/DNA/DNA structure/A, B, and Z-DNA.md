![[DNA structure - A,B,Z DNA.png|300]]

**Is there only A, B, and Z-DNA?** :: No, but these are the only known biologically active DNA molecules

B-DNA structure :: Right-handed double helix; classic DNA

Which of A, B, and Z-DNA are most similar to one another? :: A and B are most similar

##### A-DNA
**Handedness** :: Right-handed

**Stability** :: Stable at low water content (i.e. low humidity; high salt concentration)

**Appearances in nature** :: Found when B-DNA is dehydrated; may protect it

Major grooves :: Deep and narrow
Minor grooves :: Shallow and wide

Base pairs per turn :: 11 bp
Tilt of base pairs :: $\approx 20\degree$

##### Z-DNA
Read more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-DNA#Structure
**Handedness** :: Left-handed 

**Stability** :: Unstable

**Appearances in nature** :: Transient; appearing only during biological processes then disappearing

**Frequency of structure repetition** :: Repeats every other base pair

**Difference of major/minor grooves** :: Little to no difference in width
