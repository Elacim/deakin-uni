#### Structure
Is a chromosome simply an X-shape of DNA?
?
It is not the cross/X-shape that we typically see - there are two chromosomes there, one on the left, one on the right. 

What is are 'homologous chromosomes'? :: Two identical chromatids paired together (in 2n organisms)

In meiosis, what happens to homologous paternal and maternal chromosomes? :: They physically pair to their counterpart (e.g. haploid sperm + haploid egg = diploid zygote)


- In fertilisation: A recombinated paternal chromatid and maternal chromatid to form one pair of chromatids

###### Centromere
[[Chromatin|Heterochromatic]] region of a chromosome to which microtubule fibres attach during cell division
The location gives a chromosome its characteristic shape

#### Trivia
How many pairs of chromosomes in a human? :: 23 pairs. 22 autosomal pairs and 1 sex pair.

How many chromosomes total in a human? :: 46. 44 autosomal and 2 sex.

Are chromosomes homologous? :: If they are autosomal, yes. They are known as homologous pairs.

How many chromosomes at the start of G1? :: 22 unpaired chromatids + two sex chromosomes.

How many copies of the same gene are in somatic cells? :: Two as there are two sister chromatids, each being one molecule of DNA.
