What does a 2n human cell contain?
?
22 pairs of homologous chromosomes and a pair of sex chromosomes

 Polyploidy  A chromosomal number that is a multiple of the normal haploid chromosomal set
 Aneuploidy  A chromosomal number that is not an exact multiple of the haploid set

#### History of human ploidy
 Karyology has helped solve this issue  However, it took a while…  In 1912, Hans von Winiwarter reported 47 chromosomes in spermatogonia and 48 in oogonia  Theophilus Painter in 1922 favoured 48 chromosomes  Albert Levan in 1956 – the karyotype of humans includes only 46 chromosomes
