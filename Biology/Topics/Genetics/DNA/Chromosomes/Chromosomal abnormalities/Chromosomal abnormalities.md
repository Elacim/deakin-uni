2. A change in chromosomal arrangement (translocation)

 Polyploidy and aneuploidy are major causes of reproductive failure in humans  Polyploidy is seen only rarely in live births  

The rate of aneuploidy in humans is much higher than in other primates and mammals; reasons for the difference are unknown
