 Meiosis is not completed until ovulation  Intracellular events may increase risk of nondisjunction, resulting in aneuploidy 

 Maternal selection  Embryo-uterine interactions that normally abort abnormal embryos become less effective 

 Loss of cohesion may contribute to incorrect microtubule-kinetochore attachment


### Trisomies
Maternal age is the leading risk factor for trisomy
- For trisomy 21, 94% of nondisjunctions occur in the mother, 6% in the father
- The majority of nondisjunction events occur in meiosis I in oocytes


By age 42 about 1/3 identified pregnancies are trisomic
- Meiosis I is not completed until ovulation, so eggs produced at age 40 have been in meiosis I for more than 40 years.
- Intracellular events or environmental agents may have damaged the cell, so aneuploidy can result when meiosis resumes at ovulation
