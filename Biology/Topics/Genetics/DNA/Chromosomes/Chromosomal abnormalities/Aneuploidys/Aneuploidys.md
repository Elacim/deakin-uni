? :: Changes the number of individual chromosomes

**Monosomy** :: A condition in which one member of a chromosomal pair is missing; one less than the diploid number (2n â€“ 1)

**Trisomy** :: A condition in which one chromosome is present in three copies, and all others are diploid; one more than the diploid number (2n + 1)


#### Causes
Non-disjunction :: The failure of homologous chromosomes to separate properly during meiosis
- Gives rise to chromosomal variation
- Paired homologs fail to disjoin during segregation
- Nondisjunction during meiosis I or II
- Related to topoisomerase II, condensin, or separase

#### Consequences
- Aneuploidy is the leading cause of reproductive failure in humans
- Results in spontaneous abortions and birth defects
- Aneuploidy also is associated with most cancers
