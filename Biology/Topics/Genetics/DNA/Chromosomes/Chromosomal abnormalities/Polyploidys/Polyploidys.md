 Changes the number of FULL chromosome sets  Triploidy  A chromosomal number that is three times the haploid number, having three copies of all autosomes and three sex chromosomes  Tetraploidy  A chromosomal number that is four times the haploid number, having four copies of all autosomes and four sex chromosomes

#### Origin
 Origin of polyploidy  Addition of one or more sets of chromosomes identical to haploid complement of same species (autopolyploidy)  Combination of chromosome sets from different species as consequence of hybridization (allopolyploidy)
