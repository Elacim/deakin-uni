 Translocation involves exchange of chromosome parts  Often produces no overt phenotypic effects  Can result in genetically imbalanced and aneuploid gametes


#### Robertsonian translocation
? :: A Robertsonian translocation is where two acrocentric chromosomes are joined at their centromere
- e.g. chromosome 14 and 21
	- A translocation resulting in Down syndrome
		- Only difference between it and trisomy 21 is heritability
- In effect, Robertsonian translocation makes Down syndrome a heritable genetic disease
- Potentially present in one in three offspring

- About 5% of Down syndrome involve a Robertsonian translocation
- Someone carrying the translocation is phenotypically normal but produce six types of gametes
	- Three of these result in lethal conditions
	- One produces a Down syndrome child
	- One is a translocation carrier
	- One is chromosomally normal
