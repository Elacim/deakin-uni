- [[Chromosomes]]
- Any nucleus can be used to make karyotype
	- Lymphocytes, skin cells, cells from biopsies, tumour cells

**Sampling cells before birth**
- Methods to test for Down Syndrome in high risk mothers
- Amniocentesis
- Chorionic villus sampling (CVS)
- ‘percept’ cfDNA (cell free fetal DNA) from 10 weeks, ideal between 11-16 weeks




**Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)**
A method of sampling foetal chorionic cells by inserting a catheter through the vagina or abdominal wall into the uterus
- Used in diagnosing biochemical and cytogenetic defects in the embryo
- Usually performed in the eighth or ninth week of pregnancy (earlier than amniocentesis)

The chorion is the outermost fetal membrane and the villi are projections from this membrane that can be sampled without harming the fetus

**Amniocentesis**
Fetal skin cells come off and float in the amniotic fluid. These can be sampled, grown and analysed for chromosomes, enzymes or DNA. Usually performed in the 14th to 18th week of pregnancy
