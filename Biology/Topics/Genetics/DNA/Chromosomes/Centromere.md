? :: Part of a chromosome that links sister chromatids
Alternative name :: Regional centromeres (if formed on preferred regions of DNA sequences which is common)

Purpose :: The site of assembly of the kinetochore

**Types of centromeres**
?
- Type I point and 
- Type II large centromeres

##### Type I point centromeres
Size of DNA region + approx base pair count :: Very small regions of DNA (âˆ¼125 bp in length)

What are these best at? :: Efficiently binding to specific proteins that have affinities for particular DNA sequences 

What can these be used to do? :: Confer centromeric function to a DNA segment when transferred to the segment

How many microtubules can this type of centromere bind? :: One

What organism is this seen in? :: The budding yeast, *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*

![[Centromere - Type I point centromeres.png]]
##### Type II large centromeres
What organisms have these centromeres? :: Mammals

What special DNA do mammalian centromeres have? :: $\alpha$ [[Satellite DNA]]
Size of $\alpha$ tandem repeats :: 171 base pairs (bp)
Purpose of $\alpha$ satellites :: Binds to centromere-associated proteins
Size of $\alpha$ satellite repeat amount (not bp/unit) in a large centromere :: Up to 5 Megabases (Mb)

How many microtubules do these bind? :: 30-40 microtubules
