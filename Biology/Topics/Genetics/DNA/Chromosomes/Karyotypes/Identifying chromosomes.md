Three key features are used to identify chromosomal similarities and differences
1. Size. This is the easiest way to tell two different chromosomes apart
2. Centromere position. Centromeres are regions in chromosomes that appear as a constriction
3. Banding pattern. The size and location of stained bands on chromosomes make each chromosome pair unique

##### Centromere location
**Metacentric** :: A chromosome that has a centrally placed centromere
**Submetacentric** :: A chromosome whose centromere is placed closer to one end than the other
**Acrocentric** :: A chromosome whose centromere is placed very close to, but not at, one end
**Telocentric** :: A chromosome whose centromere is placed at one end of the chromatid and hence only one arm (not seen in humans)

What does *p* in *p arm* stand for? :: Petit as it is the shorter arm.
