 Karyotype  A complete set of chromosomes from a cell that has been photographed during cell division and arranged in a standard sequence  Important for cell biology and genetics, and the results may be used in evolutionary biology and medicine  Why use them?  Study chromosomal aberrations, cellular function, taxonomic relationships, and to gather information about past evolutionary events


 Karyotypes reveal variations in chromosomal structure and number  1959: Discovery that Down syndrome is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21
 Chromosome banding and other techniques can identify small changes in chromosomal structure
