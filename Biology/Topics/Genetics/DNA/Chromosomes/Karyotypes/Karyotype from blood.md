Blood is drawn from body and treated to stop coagulation

Mononuclear cells (lymphocytes and monocytes*) are purified from the blood by centrifugation

The purified cells are cultured for 3-4 days in the presence of a mitogen, which stimulates the lymphocytes to proliferate

#### Treatment
The cells are treated with a drug such as colcemid, which disrupts mitotic spindles and prevents completion of mitosis
- Enriches the population of metaphase cells

Cells are harvested and treated briefly with a hypotonic solution.
- This makes the nuclei swell osmotically

#### Result
 The swollen cells are fixed, dropped onto a microscope slide and dried  Slides are stained to induce a banding pattern  The slides are scanned to identify a clear chromosome spread, and then photographed.  Previously the image was cut up and rearranged in standard format – now days software is used
