 Chromosome number can change due to a number of reasons
- Chromosome elimination during development
- Seen in the sciarid flies
- Chromatin diminution found in some roundworms, portions of the chromosomes are cast away in particular cells
- Aneuploidy where the chromosome number in the cells is not the typical number for the species
- Polyploidy – more than two sets of chromosomes
- Can be normal for some species

The number of chromosomes in the karyotype between (relatively) unrelated species is hugely variable

The low record is held by an ant: The “Jumper ant” Myrmecia pilosula, a primitive group of ants found only in Australia. Males are haploid n = 1.
The high record would be the Adder's Tongue Fern Ophioglossum with an average of 1262 chromosomes


 The genus Muntiacus has 12 recognised species
- The Indian Muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak) is the mammal with the lowest recorded chromosome number: The male has a diploid number of 7, the female only 6 chromosomes.
- The Chinese Muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi), in comparison, has a diploid number of 46 chromosomes
