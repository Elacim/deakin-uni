The number of chromosomes in the karyotype between (relatively) unrelated species is hugely variable

The low record is held by an ant: The “Jumper ant” Myrmecia pilosula, a primitive group of ants found only in Australia. Males are haploid n = 1.
The high record would be the Adder's Tongue Fern Ophioglossum with an average of 1262 chromosomes


 The genus Muntiacus has 12 recognised species  The Indian Muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak) is the mammal with the lowest recorded chromosome number: The male has a diploid number of 7, the female only 6 chromosomes.  The Chinese Muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi), in comparison, has a diploid number of 46 chromosomes
