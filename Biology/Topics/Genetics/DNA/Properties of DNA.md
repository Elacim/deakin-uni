**Appearance of pure DNA (naked eye)** :: White and stringy clumps

**Charge of DNA** :: Negatively charged

**Acidity of DNA** :: Strong acid

**Why is DNA a strong acid?**
?
It's phosphate groups fully ionise at typical cell pH levels. The released protons from the phosphates create a negative charge.

**Main benefits of DNA being negatively charged**
?
- Negative charges repel nucleophiles that could hydrolyse the DNA which could lead to structural failure
- Histones easily bind to DNA
- As negative charges repel, DNA naturally straightens out when undergoing transcription
