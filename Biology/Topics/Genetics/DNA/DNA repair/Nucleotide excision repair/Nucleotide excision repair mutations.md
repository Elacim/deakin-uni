 Most of us have efficient nucleotide excision repair mechanisms that remove thymine dimers and many other damages in DNA
- Individuals who have mutations that prevent DNA repair are very susceptible to skin damage and cancer
- E.g. Xeroderma pigmentosa


 Xeroderma pigmentosum
- Autosomal recessive genetic disorder where nucleotide excision repair enzymes are mutated
- The ability to repair damage caused by ultraviolet light is deficient
- All exposure to sunlight must be forbidden
- Fewer than 40% of individuals with the disease survive beyond age 20 years, dying from multiple skin cancers
	- 2000-fold higher rate of cancer than general population
