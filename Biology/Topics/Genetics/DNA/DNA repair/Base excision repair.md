ï‚— Corrects DNA that contains a damaged DNA base
- Firstly, DNA glycosylase recognises the altered base
	- Different DNA glycosylases for specific bases
- Glycosidic bond between base and sugar cut
- Sugar with missing base recognised by AP endonuclease
	- Enzyme makes cut in phosphodiester backbone
- Gap filled by DNA polymerase and DNA ligase
- Occurs throughout the cell cycle
