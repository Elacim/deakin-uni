**Purpose** :: Essential to the maintenance of genetic integrity of organisms and their survival

**Is DNA repair done in discrete stages?** :: Not necessarily, it can have many steps that are done concurrently

**Does repair occur during DNA replication?** :: Proof reading occurs during replication

**Types of repair**
?
- Post-replication repair
- Base excision repair
- Nucleotide excision repair
- Double-strand break repair
