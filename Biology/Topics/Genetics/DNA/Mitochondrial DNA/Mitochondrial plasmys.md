**Heteroplasmy** :: Is the presence of a mixture of more than one type of an organellar genome (mitochondrial DNA) within a cell or tissue

**Homoplasmy** :: A state in which all the mitochondria of a cell or a tissue have the same genome, which may be either the wild type genome or a mutated one

To identify the remains, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) samples were taken. mtDNA from four female skeletons exactly matched those of Prince Philip, a living paternal relative of Tsarina Alexandra, providing strong evidence that the remains were those of the Tsarina and three of her daughters


The sample from the presumed skeleton of the Tsar was heteroplasmic, the mtDNA matched a maternal relative, except for one site where the 2 nucleotides were segregating. 

Sequencing the mtDNA from the Tsarâ€™s brother Georgij Romanov showed heteroplasmy at the same position
