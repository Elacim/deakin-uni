• Discovered in the 1960, DNA-like fibers within mitochondria
- Most mtDNA molecules are circular (exception: alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii = linear)
- Cluster in nucleoids, attached to the inner membrane 

• Mitochondria have their own independent genome of about 16 Kb
- mtDNA is circular – bacterial origin
- 37 genes – tightly packed (no introns)
- Most mitochondrial proteins are encoded by the nuclear genome
- Not all mitochondrial diseases are due to mutations in mitochondrial DNA
- LHON is one of the few diseases caused by mutations of mitochondrial DNA
