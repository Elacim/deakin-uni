 Erwin Chargaff (1952) analysed the composition of DNA from many different organisms and found: 
- Concentration of T(Thymine) = concentration of A (Adenine)
- Concentration of C (Cytosine) = concentration of G (Guanine)'

 Therefore, concluded that they exist in pairs (base pairs) and thus always equal in concentration  But \[T+A]/\[C+G] ratio varied widely in different organisms. Humans have a more \[T+A] in DNA (60%)  WHY in human? We don’t really know
