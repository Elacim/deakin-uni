How? :: By using [[RNA]]'s secondary structure

• The lac repressor and CAP proteins are examples of DNA-binding regulatory proteins that interact with the operator regions to regulate gene expression
- Prokaryote gene regulation also occurs through interactions of regulatory molecules with specific regions of the mRNA
- This occurs after transcription initiation
- Causes alterations to the secondary structure of mRNA - Leads to termination of transcription or repressed translation

**Leader sequence** :: transcription proceeds along the leader sequence prior to the first structural gene- 5’UTR

[[Tryptophan attenuation]] - **Attenuation** :: leader sequence contains an attenuator sequence, which can cause transcription or translation to stop and an attenuated (non- functional) mRNA or protein is formed. 

**Riboswitches** :: leader sequence contains a binding site, which if bound by a ligand (simple or complex binding molecule) can cause transcription to terminate.
