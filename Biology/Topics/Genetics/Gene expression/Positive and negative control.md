Gene induction and repression can be negatively or positively controlled:

**Negative control** :: When gene expression is actively ‘turned off’ by a (negative) regulatory molecule/complex.

**Positive control** :: When gene expression is actively ‘turned on’ by a (positive) regulatory molecule/complex. 

- Inducible does not imply positive control, nor does repressible imply negative control
