**?** :: Creating a protein from a gene

**What are the two basic steps?**
?
Transcription (transcribed) - DNA to mRNA
and
Translation - mRNA to protein

**Template strand (antisense strand)** :: DNA strand that is transcribed
**Coding strand (sense strand)** :: mRNA strand that specifies amino acid sequence of encoded protein

From DNA to gene: gene expression is tightly regulated where not all genes are expressed all the time
