**Promoter** :: Region of DNA to initiate gene transcription 

**Operator (O gene)** :: Contain sequences that control transcription of the gene cluster: bind activator or repressor molecules

**cis-acting site** :: Same strand as gene cluster 

**Regulatory gene** :: Code for regulatory activator or repressor molecules: trans-acting elements (can be many bp away). Far away things are called trans.

**Polycistronic mRNA** :: One mRNA molecule translated into separate proteins
