**Operons** :: Sections of DNA that contain a cluster of genes under the control of a single [[Transcription promoters|promoter]]

**Purpose of operons** :: Organisation of their genes that code for similar enzymes and functions in clusters

**Main organism types where operons are found** :: They are regular occurrences in bacteria and other prokaryotes.

**Are operons found in Eukaryotes?** :: Yes but only rarely.
