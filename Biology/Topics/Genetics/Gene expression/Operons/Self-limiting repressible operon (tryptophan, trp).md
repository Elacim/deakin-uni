• E. coli can produce enzymes necessary for the biosynthesis of amino acids
- Five contiguous genes on the E. coli chromosome code for tryptophan synthesis, the trp operon
- In the presence of tryptophan all enzymes are repressed
- The repressor molecule alone cannot bind to the operator
- The repressor molecule contains a binding site for tryptophan, changing conformation and binding to the operator
- Tryptophan is a co-repressor negatively regulating it’s own production
	- If in the environment, it isn't transcribed
