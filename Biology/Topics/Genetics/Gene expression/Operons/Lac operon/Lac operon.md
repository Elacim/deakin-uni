? :: The operon controlling lactose enzyme production

**Type of expression** :: Negative control; inducible 

**Effect of no lactose**
?
- The repressor (I) encodes a molecule that blocks the operator and therefore the transcription of structural genes
- The operator being blocked inhibits [[RNA polymerase]]

**Effect of lactose being present**
?
- Lactose sugar binds to the repressor causing [[Conformational change]]
- Repressor-operator released allowing the promoter to freely transcribe lactose processing genes

From the Lac operon, scientists can add a gratuitous inducer (e.g. IPTG)
