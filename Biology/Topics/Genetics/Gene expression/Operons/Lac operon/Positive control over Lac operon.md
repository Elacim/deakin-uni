Catabolite-Activating Protein CAP Regulation of the lac operon is more complex and depends on the preferred sugar source glucose

Allosteric transition :: change in conformation of a molecule

##### Glucose absent
• Under lactose inducible conditions RNApol binding is not efficient unless CAP is present
- CAP exerts positive control by binding to the promotor and facilitating transcription
- CAP binding requires the molecule cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate)
- Low levels of glucose = high levels of cAMP

##### Glucose present
![[Positive control over Lac operon - CAP.png]]• Presence of glucose: cAMP levels decrease
- The presence of glucose inhibits the enzyme adenyl cyclase decreasing cAMP
- CAP cannot form the cAMP-CAP complex for positive control of the lac operon
- CAP can’t bind to promoter, Lac operon down-regulated
