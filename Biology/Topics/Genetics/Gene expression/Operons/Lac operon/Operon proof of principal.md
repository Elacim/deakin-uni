Found through lactose metabolism in *E. coli*

- Repressor - operator interaction
- No lactose: repressor gene encodes a molecule that blocks transcription of the structural genes
	- Blocks the operator, RNA polymerase is inhibited
- Presence of Lactose: this sugar binds to the repressor causing a conformational change to the molecule 
	- Repressor-operator interaction released, promotor free, structural genes transcribed
