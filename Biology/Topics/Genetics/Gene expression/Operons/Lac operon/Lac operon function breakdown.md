E. coli prefer glucose/monosaccharides over lactose.

#### Enzyme functions
$\beta$-galactosidase :: Cleaves the disaccharide lactose into its monosaccharide components glucose and galactose. 

Permease function :: Allows lactose to enter bacterial cells.  

Transacetylase function :: Involved in the removal of waste by-products from the digestion of lactose.

#### Encoding genes
**Lac Z encodes** :: $\beta$-galactosidase, 

**Lac Y encodes** :: Permease

**Lac A encodes** :: Transacetylase

**I encodes** :: A repressor protein
Purpose of I :: A trans-acting transcription regulator

**O encodes** :: Nothing, it is non-coding
Purpose of O :: Contains cis-acting binding sites
