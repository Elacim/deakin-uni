Negatively controlled gene that is induced by the environment and the removal of a repressor = negative inducible operon

##### Repressed
![[Negative inducible operon.png]]Absence of lactose: the repressor molecule binds to the operator which inhibits RNA polymerase from attaching and polymerising the transcript

##### Induced
