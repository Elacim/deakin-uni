e. coli lactose summary
1. In the absence of lactose the lac operon is repressed by a repressor molecule
2. The presence of lactose forms a complex with the repressor molecule which stops it binding to the operator, transcription proceeds
3. In the absence of tryptophan the trp operon is activated as the repressor cannot bind alone
4. The presence of tryptophan forms a complex with the repressor molecule that binds to the operator, transcription is diminished

Recap: Greater levels of complexity negative and positive control of the lac operon: lactose metabolism is regulated by glucose catabolites: 
Selective gene regulation: E. coli greatly prefers glucose over lactose

If you grow this bacteria in a medium with both glucose and lactose, is that it selectively turns off lactose metabolism and uses straight glucose for its cellular respiration. The products of breaking down of glucose prevent the signalling molecule cAMP. 
When glucose levels start getting low, the lac operon is activated positively by high levels of cAMP and lactose is back
