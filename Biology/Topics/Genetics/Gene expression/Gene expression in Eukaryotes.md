1. Different types of [[Chromatin]] allow or inhibit access to genes
2. Regulation of transcription initiation frequency
3. [[Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA]]

Initiation: gene turns on
Termination: gene turns off

- is highly controlled to express required levels of gene products
	- At specific times
	- Cell types
	- Responses to environment
- Single genes controlled by a single promoter
- Transcription initiation control (Activators, repressors)
- Lots of DNA = complex packaging = added gene regulation
- Has nucleus = transport control
- Post transcriptional modifications (mRNA splicing, cap and poly A tail)
- Post translational modifications (digestion, glycosylation, phosphorylation)
