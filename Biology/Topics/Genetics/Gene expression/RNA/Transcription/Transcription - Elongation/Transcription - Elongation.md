ï‚— RNA Polymerase unwinds DNA through helicase activity
- The RNA polymerase incorporates nucleotides through complementary base pairing
- RNA has uracil instead of thymine, and this binds to adenine on the DNA template
- A strand of RNA is synthesised as the enzyme complex moves along the template DNA
- The separated strands of DNA come back together and the RNA is dissociated
- The whole process of elongation is dependent on energy from ATP
- Long, full length transcripts are produced
