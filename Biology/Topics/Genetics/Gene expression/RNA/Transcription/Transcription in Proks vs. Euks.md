 In prokaryotes transcription and translation can occur at the same time (no nucleus) Fig 13.16
- In prokaryotes (e.g. E.coli) many genes can be transcribed together into one large mRNA (polycistronic)


 Transcription factors are needed for eukaryotic RNA polymerases – e.g. enhancers and silencers
- Chromatin nucleosomes (histone structures) in eukaryotes need to be uncoiled – called chromatin remodelling
- Eukaryotic genes have introns (intervening sequences) that need to be spiced from pre-mRNA. Usually no introns in prokaryotes
