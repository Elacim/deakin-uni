 The synthesised mRNA must be processed before it is exported to the cytoplasm for translation
- Three processing steps for mRNA that happen in the nucleus: 
1. A 7-methylguanosine (MG) cap is added to 5’ end 
2. A poly(A) tail is added to 3’ end (polyadenylation) 
3. Intron sequences are removed (splicing)

ALL these steps can happen concurrently
