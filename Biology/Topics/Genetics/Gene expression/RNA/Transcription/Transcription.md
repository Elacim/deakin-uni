**What does -10 refer to in DNA sequences?** :: 10 bp before (upstream) the transcription start. -847 would be 847 bp upstream. +5 would be 5 downstream. 

 Transcription begins at particular DNA sequences known as promoter sequences
- Initiation of transcription is controlled by binding of the enzyme RNA polymerase and other proteins to the promoter
- The RNA polymerase copies the DNA sequence into RNA



**Asymmetric transcription**
 Both DNA strands can be used as RNA templates  The transcription direction on different strands is opposite  This feature is referred to as the asymmetric transcription
