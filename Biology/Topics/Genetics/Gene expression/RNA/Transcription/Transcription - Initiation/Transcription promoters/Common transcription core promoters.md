**Common promoters**
?
- TATA box 
- Regulatory sequences


ï‚— Contains many conserved DNA sequence elements that are required for proper binding and positioning of RNA polymerase
- Almost always have TATA box, BRE, Inr domains.
- Many have MTE, DPE, GCC-box and CAAT box domains.
- Enhancer and Silencer regions up and down stream also improve RNA pol binding.
