**What are promoters?**
?
- 5' DNA sequences the transcribing proteins ([[RNA polymerase]]) can recognise and attach to.
- Binding site for other enhancing proteins

Types :: Focused and dispersed

What are promoter regions recognised by? :: [[Transcription factors|Transcription factor]] proteins


**Location of promoters in relation to the gene** :: Upstream of the (structural) gene to be transcribed, i.e. before the gene

**Location of gene in relation to promoters** :: Downstream, i.e. ahead of the promoter


Are promoters transcribed? :: No.

Across species, are promoters similar? :: Yes, as they have a critical role, they are highly conserved.
