Focused region :: Promoter region with either a single or distinct cluster of transcription start sites

Dispersed region :: Promoter region with several, non-clustered transcription start sites over 50-100 nucleotides

Main use of focused promoters
?
Used when specific cell types need specific proteins with little wiggle room. 

 focused initiation preferentially occurs in core promoters of highly cell-type-specific genes with restricted
expression patterns, whereas dispersed initiation is mainly associated with housekeeping genes expressed in many cell
types
