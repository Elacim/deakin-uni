ï‚— After initiation, the RNA polymerase must clear the promoter
- Abortive initiation
- Tendency for RNA polymerase to release the RNA transcript and produce truncated transcripts

- This, like most of the remainder of transcription, is an energy-dependent process, consuming adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
