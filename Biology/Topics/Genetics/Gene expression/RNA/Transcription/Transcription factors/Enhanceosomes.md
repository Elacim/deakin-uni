 Trans-acting sites on [[Transcription factors]] can bind to co-activators  Can cause DNA to bend and form an Enhanceosome.  Can increase the efficiency of RNA polymerase binding and transcription initiation.

The enhanceosome is a higher-order protein complex assembled at the enhancer and regulates expression of a target gene.
