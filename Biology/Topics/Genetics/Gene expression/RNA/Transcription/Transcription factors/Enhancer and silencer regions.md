[[Transcription factors]]
ï‚— cis-acting sites that are bound by specific trans-acting factors called transcription factors (TFs, often called response elements).
- TFs that activate transcription = activators- recruit RNApol.
- TFs that reduce transcription = repressors- block recruitment of RNApol II.
