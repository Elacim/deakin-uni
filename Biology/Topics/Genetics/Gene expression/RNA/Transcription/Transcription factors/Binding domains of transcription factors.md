ï‚— There are three main types of DNA binding domains
- Zinc finger
- Helix-turn-Helix
- Leucine zipper (bZIP)

These domain regions of the TFs bind to the cis-acting sites present within promoters and enhancer/silencer regions.

The other domain acts as a trans - activating/repressing region that can activate or repress transcription.
