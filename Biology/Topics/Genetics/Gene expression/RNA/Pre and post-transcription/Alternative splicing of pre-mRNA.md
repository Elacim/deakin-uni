ï‚— Immature RNA (pre-mRNA) contains [[Introns and exons]].
- Introns are spliced out in spliceosomes and exons are ligated together.
- Different combinations of exons can result in different proteins.
- This causes the number of possible proteins that can be produced (proteome) in a cell exceed the number of genes in the genome
