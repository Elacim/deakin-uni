 Immature proteins require peptide processing to be active  Differences in processing can result in different protein functions and/or activities.


Modifications of proteins, peptide processing
Addition of chemical groups (reversible)
Amino acid modification (irreversible)
Cleavage (irreversible)
Addition of polypeptides (reversible)
