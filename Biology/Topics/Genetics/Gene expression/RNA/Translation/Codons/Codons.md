 The coding region of the mRNA consists of a sequence of nucleotides that specifies a particular order of amino acids  Every three consecutive nucleotides in mRNA is a codon  Each codon specifies an amino acid  E.g. the sequence AUG CCC contains two codons that specify methionine and proline

Sense codon :: Any codon except stop

**What is the 'genetic code'?** :: A shared set of rules that cells use to turn codons into proteins

**How many codons in the genetic code?** :: 64 total (including duplicates)

**How many codons are unique?** :: 20 (inc. START) + 3 (STOPs)
