 Translation of mRNA occurs in the cytoplasm on ribosomes  Ribosomes consist of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and proteins  Transfer RNA used as an adapter between an amino acid and the mRNA codon  A codon is a triplet of bases that specifies an amino acid

 There are two ribosomal subunits.  The small subunit binds the mRNA  The large subunit has binding sites for the tRNAs and also has an enzyme that forms the peptide bond.
