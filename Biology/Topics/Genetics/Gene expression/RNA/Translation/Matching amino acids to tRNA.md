 There must be a correct match between a tRNA and its amino acid
- A tRNA that binds to an mRNA codon specifying a particular amino acid must carry only that amino acid
- Each amino acid is joined to the correct tRNA by means of a specific enzyme called aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase.
- There are 20 different aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases – one for each amino acid.
