? :: Polymerase chain reaction

Process :: Denature ($95\degree \ce{C}$), anneal ($55-65\degree \ce{C}$), then extend ($72\degree \ce{C}$) $\times 30+$ 

#### General process
• DNA replication carried out in vitro • Uses a pair of primers that are specific (complementary) to the DNA which is to be amplified. • Each primer flanks the ends of the DNA which is to be amplified • PCR utilises a thermostable DNA polymerase (Taq – from Thermos aquaticus)

#### Requirements
- TEMPLATE gDNA/cDNA/RNA
- PRIMERS: Specific bits of DNA to aid specific amplification of DNA segments
- Thermostable DNA polymerase- Taq/Pfu/Vent/Deep Vent
- DNA polymerase buffer (to keep optimal activity of enzyme)
- A means to carry out thermal cycling- Thermocycler

**Template DNA ingredients**
Buffer 
Forward Primer 
Reverse Primer 
MgCl2 
dNTPs 
Taq 
H2O



#### Applications
 Diagnostics for infectious disease: bacteria or viruses (HIV, HPV) etc.  Diagnosing genetic disorders: by synthesizing allele-specific probes  Forensic applications- Short Tandem Repeats (STRs), VNTRs etc profiling  Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR)  Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)
