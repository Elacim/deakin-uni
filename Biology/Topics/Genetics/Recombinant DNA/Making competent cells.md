Bacterial cells that are made competent are more likely to take up plasmid containing the foreign DNA

Cells are made competent in different ways based on the transformation protocol to be utilised later

1. **Heat shock method**
	- Utilises initial cooling on ice followed by a incubation at high temperature (37-42 Â°C)
	- Cells are made competent with $\ce{CaCl2}$
2. **Electroporation method**
	- Utilises a high voltage to permeabilised the membrane to allow uptake of foreign DNA
	- Cells are prepared in log phase with diminished salt concentration (10% glycerol)
