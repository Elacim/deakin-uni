Antibiotic selection marker: Ampicillin, Kanamycin

Ampicillin-resistance gene (ampr) encodes β-lactamase, which inactivates the antibiotic ampicillin. 
E. coli that take up the plasmid can be easily selected from those cells that do not by growing them in an ampicillin-containing medium.

LacZ: β-galactosidase enzyme that metabolizes lactose- the cloned DNA will be inserted in this gene and disrupt the function
