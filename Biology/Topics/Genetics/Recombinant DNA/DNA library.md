? :: A collection of DNA fragments that have been cloned into vectors and from which interest of DNA can be isolated.

**Genomic libraries**
large fragments of DNA in bacteriophages or bacterial artificial chromosomes

**cDNA libraries (complimentary DNA)**
- cloned, reverse-transcribed mRNA (no DNA sequences corresponding to genomic regions without introns)
- much smaller fragments cloned into plasmid vectors with bacterial uptake and selection
