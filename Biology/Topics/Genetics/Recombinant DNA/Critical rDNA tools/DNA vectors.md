**Vector** :: DNA molecules that can be used to artificially incorporate and replicate the target sequence of interest into another cell- bacteria

Types :: Bacterial plasmids, phage vector systems, bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), and Yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs).
YACs are best used for... :: Lots of DNA changes 

- A vector contains several restriction sites that allow insertion of the DNA fragments to be cloned.
- Vectors must be capable of replicating in host cells to allow for independent replication of the vector DNA and any DNA fragment it carries.
- To distinguish host cells that have taken up vectors from host cells that have not, the vector carry a selectable marker gene (antibiotic resistance gene)
- Incorporate specific sequences that allow for sequencing inserted DNA


#### Mammalian expression vectors
 Similar to bacterial transformation  Designed for transient or stable expression of target gene  How? Contains viral Ori and promotor sequences (eg. CMV or SV40)  Have different antibiotic selection markers (geniticin, hygromycin, blasticidin or puromycin)
