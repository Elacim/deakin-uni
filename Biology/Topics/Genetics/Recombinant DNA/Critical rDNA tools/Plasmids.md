 - Prokaryotes *can* contain rings of extrachrosomal DNA called plasmids
	 - Plasmids often contain antibiotic resistance genes
	 - Important in Biotechnology
	 - These are 'added bonuses' (i.e. non-essential) to the prokaryote 

Plasmids exists naturally in bacteria separate from the bacterial DNA: they self replicate, contain an origin of replication and usually important genes for the bacteria's survival such as antibiotic genes
