Leader: (lead) promotor sequence cis acting 

Two types of RNA Cas9: 
TracrRNA: In cas9 systems tracrRNA pairs with crRNA to form a functional guide RNA gRNA. Trans acting.

Cas9 uses the trcrRNA portion of the guide as a handle, crRNA spacer sequence guides the complex to the complementary viral sequence
