"If restriction enzymes are axes, CRISPR is a laser scalpel"

[[Restriction enzymes]] exist naturally in bacteria to attack an chop viruses up into smaller and non harmful pieces. More primitive less precise cuts. Does not confer resistance.

CRISPR in itâ€™s natural state involves two RNAs and a protein. Advanced system, allows extremely precise cuts. Confers resistance to foreign genetic elements (viruses and plasmids). RNA guided nuclease
