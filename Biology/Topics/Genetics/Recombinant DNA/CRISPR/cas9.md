4 Cas genes are located upstream of the 12 repeat spacer units. Cas9 is a large multi-domain protein • RuvC-like nuclease domain (cleavage of nucleic acid, single or double stranded breaks). Cleaves the non-complementary strand • HNH nuclease domain cleaves the complimentary strand


CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays are transcribed and processed into a set of short CRISPR RNAs cRNAs

Repeat spacer array :: All CRISPR arrays contain a series of repeats interspersed by short sequences called spacers which match previously invading DNA and can incorporate new invading DNA (adaptive immunity)
