• 1. Favour HDR using chemical modification- inhibit key enzymes of NHNJ • 2. Timed delivery of the CRISPR-Cas9 system: synchronise and capture cells as S and G2 phases or use timed delivery • 3. Other enhancements such as modified Cas9


HDR comes into action mostly in the S or G2 phase of the cell cycle and relies on homologous sequences- sister chromatids

NHEJ is active throughout the cell cycle. First reaction robust predominant high flexibility. Error prone
