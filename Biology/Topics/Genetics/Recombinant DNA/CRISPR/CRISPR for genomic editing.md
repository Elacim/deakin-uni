• Cas9 recruitment to the target DNA is mediated by a chimeric single-guide RNA (sgRNA). 
• It contains a protospacer recognising the target sequence followed by protopacer adjacent motif (PAM) 
- The DSBs are repaired by NHEJ (indels) or 
	- HDR using a synthetic donor as the template for introduced sequence changes

• The DSB triggers genome editing via 2 different repair mechanisms in eukaryotes 
1. When you have no homologous DNA template DSBs can be repaired by NHEJ which leaves small insertions or deletions 
2. The presence of a synthetic repair template can be repaired by HDR so you can introduce any sequence. 
3. Aims to repair disease causing alleles by changing the DNA sequence at the exact location on the chromosome
