Why is CRISPR so error prone?
- The chimeric single-guide RNA (sgRNA) contains a 20nt guide sequence directs Cas9 to the genomic target- multiple mismatches between the guide and the target can be tolerated, but leads to off target DSBs
- If it finds one where 18/20 match it can make the edit anyway
- Cryo-electron microscopy showed a strange finger-like structure that reached out and stabilised the DNA so Cas9 could make its edit.
- The reserachers tweaked Cas9 so it pushes the finger structure away. Lab-made SuperFi-Cas9 should be $4000\times$ more precise
