2007*: Researchers demonstrated that Prokaryotes have
evolved a nucleic-acid based immune system where
specificity is dictated by CRISPR and resistance is provided
by the Cas enzymatic machinery.

This contrasts to Eukaryotes who utilise amino-acid based
immunity.

Not only that, but bacteria integrate new sequences derived
from phage DNA as part of an 'adaptive immune response'.
This provides immunity to variable phage attacks.
