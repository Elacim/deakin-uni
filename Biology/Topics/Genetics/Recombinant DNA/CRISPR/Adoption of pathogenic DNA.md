1. Adaptation: Invading DNA is cut and incorporated into the CRISPR locus (spacer) 
2. Biogenesis: The locus is transcribed as single non- coding pre-crRNA that gets further processed into short stretches of mature crRNA. 
3. Interference: Together with the a second non-coding RNA (trcrRNA) the crRNA forms a ribonucleoprotein complex with endonuclease Cas9. Recognises and cuts invading DNA (dS breaks)

PAM: Protospacer Adjacent Motif
- 2-6 bp DNA sequence immediately following the invading DNA. 
- PAM is part of virus or plasmid but not bacteria and is essential for Cas9 to work so the bacteria does not target itâ€™s own Cas9 complex
