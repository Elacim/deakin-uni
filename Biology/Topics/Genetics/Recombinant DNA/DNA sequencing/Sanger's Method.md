? :: Method of DNA sequencing

Dideoxynucleotide (ddNTP) chain termination 
**Requires:**
- DNA template
- Primer
- DNA Polymerase
- dNTPs
- ddNTPs

Chain termination method :: Identify the order of nucleotides of a particular gene or genome which is used to this day

Who developed the chain termination method? :: Frederick Sanger in 1977

Done using capillary electrophoresis

Relies on the synthetic ddNTPs (dideoxynucleotides)
	- fluorescent/radioactively labelled DNA fragments from a template strand
	- Terminator bases (fragment length depends on these)
DNA synthesis starts at 3' end, the ddNTP stops this **SLIDE 3a-3b**
- lots and lots of DNA -> any strand should be accounted for

Sanger sequencing requirements:
- Template DNA
- Synthetic primers (that flank the target DNA forwards and backwards) 
- Excess dNTPs and small amount of labelled ddNTPs
- Taq DNA polymerase
A laser going through the strands into a detector
	- 3'-5' instead of 5'-3' (seems random?)
	- Shortest read first, longest read last
	- Terminator fluoresced colour gives the DNA sequence 

PCR starts priming -> results in Sanger are unreliable
After priming, the results should have clear peaks for each nucleotide in a chromatogram
- Multiple peaks on a single nucleotide indicate frameshift mutation
- Size of peak on incorrect nucleotide is an indication of the somatic load
	- mutated somatic cell count

Use:
- detect polymorphisms
- genetic profiles on individuals/populations/species/traits of interest/adaptations
