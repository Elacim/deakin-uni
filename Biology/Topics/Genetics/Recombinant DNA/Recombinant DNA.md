• rDNA technology allows us to artificially combine DNA sequences from different sources • Allows us to “clone” a sequence or gene of interest into vectors and allowing their transfer to a new genome to introduce the genetic trait

#### Common procedure
1. LacZ mutant E.coli (bacteria) 
2. vector (genetically altered plasmid)
3. Chuck them all in a petri dish and pick incorporated bacteria
4.
