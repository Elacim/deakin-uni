**Relies on:**
1. Identifying recombinant bacteria (mutant E. coli) -this relies on the activity of the E. coli β- galactosidase enzyme 
2. Disrupting the LacZ gene

Alone- the mutant E. Coli lacZΔM15 cannot produce β- galactosidase
-> Presence of lactose triggers the lacZ operon in E. coli.

#### Background
- Presence of lactose in the medium triggers the lacZ operon in E. coli 
- Operon activity leads to the production of β-galactosidase enzyme that metabolizes the lactose
- The E. coli are competent cells containing lacZΔM15 deletion mutation (truncated β-galactosidase produced)
- Plasmid vectors carry a short segment of lacZ gene (only the first 146 amino acids of β-galactosidase)
- When the plasmid vector is taken up by such cells, due to [[alpha-complementation]] process, a functional β-galatosidase enzyme is produced

- Multiple cloning sites (MCS) are present in the lacZ sequence of the plasmid
- Foreign DNA can be inserted by nicking the MCS by restriction enzymes
- Foreign DNA interrupts the lacZ gene in the plasmid vector = no β- galactosidase fragment produced
- Plasmid with foreign DNA taken up by the host E. coli
- α-complementation does not occur = no functional β-galactosidase enzyme is produced
- If **foreign DNA is not inserted or inserted outside of the lacZ/MCS**, the lacZ gene will function in the plasmid vector and its product will complement the lacZ deletion mutation in the host E. coli producing a functional β- galactosidase enzyme.


## Screening
- A chromogenic substrate known as X-gal is added to the agar plate
- When β-galactosidase is produced X-gal is hydrolyzed, resulting in an insoluble blue pigment
- Colonies that haven’t taken up the foreign DNA (non-recombinant cells) and hence produce β-galactosidase, appear blue in colour
- Colonies that contain the foreign DNA (recombinant), and hence do not produce β-galactosidase, appear white
- The desired recombinant colonies can be easily picked and cultured

- Gratuitous inducer (IPTG) is used with X-gal for blue-white screening
- IPTG is a non-metabolizable analogue that induces the expression of lacZ gene
- IPTG is not a substrate for β-galactosidase but only an inducer
