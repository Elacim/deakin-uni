How to say it? :: Toe-poe-i-so-mer-ayz

Alternate name :: Gyrase

**Purpose** :: Breaks, swivels, and rejoins the parental DNA ahead of the [[Replication Fork]]

Likened to... :: ...a broken zipper that fixes itself when DNA is ready to continue unwinding

\
 Topoisomerase I puts a single stranded break (phosphodiester bonds) in DNA ahead of the replication fork  This allows the DNA to swivel as it is unwound https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4fbPUGKurI
