 Introns are removed from the primary RNA transcript while it is still in the nucleus
- Introns are “spliced out” by RNA/protein hybrids called spliceosomes
- The intron sequences are removed, and the remaining ends are re- attached so the final RNA consists of exons only
- snRNPs: Small ribonuclear proteins
