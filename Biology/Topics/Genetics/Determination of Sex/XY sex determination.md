 Found in humans, most other mammals, some insects (Drosophila) and some plants (Ginkgo)- Females have two of the same kind of sex chromosome (XX) – the homogametic sex  Males have two distinct sex chromosomes (XY) – the heterogametic sex  In humans, the presence of a Y chromosome = male and the absence of a Y chromosome = female  Not the case in all XY organisms (Drosophila)



##### In Humans
 Sex of an individual is defined at three levels
1) Chromosomal sex
2) Gonadal sex
3) Phenotypic sex

The chromosomal sex of an individual (XX or XY) can differ from the phenotypic sex
![[XY sex determination - XX, X, XXY, and XY.png]]

#### Chromosomal sex
- established at fertilisation

Other aspects of sex depend on the interaction of genes and environmental factors, especially hormones
- Within embryo 
- Among embryos
- In utero factors

#### Gonadal sex differentiation
  For the first 7 or 8 weeks, the embryo is neither male nor female
 - Two undifferentiated gonads
 - Both male and female reproductive duct systems develop
 
 Depending on how key genes are expressed causes gonads to develop as testes or ovaries, establishing gonadal sex
 - Alternative pathways can produce intermediates

 Y Chromosome and testis development  SRY gene  Sex-determining region of the Y chromosome  Located near the end of the short arm of the Y chromosome  Plays a major role in causing the undifferentiated gonad to develop into a testis

![[XY sex determination - SRY gene.png]]

 Before sexual differentiation, both male and female embryos have bipotential gonads  They possess both Wolffian and Müllerian ducts  These ducts can differentiate into male or female reproductive organs according to the hormonal status of the foetus

###### Female development
 Female development  Requires the absence of the Y chromosome and the presence of two X chromosomes- NO SRY gene expression  Embryonic gonad develops as an ovary  In the absence of testosterone, the Wolffian duct system degenerates  In the absence of (Müllerian inhibiting hormone) MIH, the Müllerian duct system forms female reproductive system

#### Chromosomal vs. Phenotypic sex
 Chromosomal sex vs. phenotypic sex  Mutations can uncouple chromosomal sex from phenotypic sex

A mutation in the X-linked androgen receptor gene (AR) causes XY males to become phenotypic females

Testosterone is produced, but not testosterone receptors; cells develop as females

**Androgen insensitivity**  An X-linked genetic trait that causes XY individuals to develop into phenotypic females
 XY female with androgen insensitivity
- Santhi Soundarajan is a phenotypic female who has an XY chromosomal constitution and has androgen insensitivity
- Body produces testosterone but NO receptor for it – phenotypically female

#### Phenotypic sex
[[SLE254 Lecture 6 - Sex determination_1PP.pdf#page=25&selection=0,0,0,31|SLE254 Lecture 6 - Sex determination_1PP, page 25]]
 Sex phenotype can change at puberty  Pseudohermaphroditism – an autosomal genetic condition that causes XY individuals to develop the phenotype of females  Caused by mutations in several different genes  Affected individuals have both male and female structures, but at different times of life  At puberty, females change into males

**The expression of X chromosomes**
 Females have two X chromosomes, males have one; yet the amount of gene product is the same HOW?  Human females have one X chromosome inactivated in all somatic cells to balance the expression of X- linked genes in males and females

Dosage compensation
- A mechanism that regulates the expression of sex-linked gene products

Barr bodies and X inactivation
Mary Lyon hypothesis
- Dosage compensation in mammalian females
- Random inactivation of one X chromosome in females equalizes the activity of X-linked genes in males and females

- Inactivation of X chromosome is random, occurs in somatic cells at an early stage of embryonic development and is then passed on to progeny cells by mitosis- PERMENANT

Barr body = An inactivated X chromosome, tightly coiled
Shows as a densely staining mass in the somatic nuclei of mammalian females
![[XY sex determination - Expression of X chromosomes.png]]

- Males (46,XY) have no Barr bodies
- Normal females (46,XX) have one Barr body  Mutations: female with 5 X chromosomes (49, XXXXX) has four Barr bodies
- Rule (of thumb): The number of Barr bodies is one less than the number of X chromosomes (n-1)

##### Counting
 X inactivation centre  Inactivation begins and is regulated from the X inactivation centre (Xic) of the X chromosome  X inactivation centre (Xic)  Region on the X chromosome where inactivation begins  Xic contains the gene XIST which encodes an long non- coding RNA that coats the inactive X and somehow silences it  Tsix (an antisense partner of Xist) and Xite HOW DOES THIS WORK????? How does counting of X chromosomes works???

**Effects of random X chromosome inactivation**
 Effects of random X chromosome inactivation  Random X inactivation can cause twins with identical genotypes to have different phenotypes The pedigree shows identical twins who are discordant for the phenotype of colour blindness 

- Can be incomplete
- Can both be inactivated

Almost all the active Xs in the colour blind twin carry the mutant allele, and in the non colour blind twin, most of the active Xs carry the normal allele
