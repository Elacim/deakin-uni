 In the ZW system it is the ovum that determines the sex of the offspring  In contrast to the XY system and the X0 system  The letters Z and W are used to distinguish this system from the XY system.  Males are the homogametic sex (ZZ)  Females are heterogametic (ZW)  The Z chromosome is larger and has more genes, like the X chromosome in the XY system

Examples:
Butterflies, birds, most reptiles, fish, crustaceans


**TSD (Temperature dependent Sex Determination)**
Sex determination depends on incubation temperature of eggs during critical period of embryonic development. 
 Pivotal temperature (Tp)  How does it work? Unclear  Metabolic / Physiological parameters Androgen Aromatase Estrogen
