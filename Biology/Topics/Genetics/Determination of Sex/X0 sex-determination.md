**There is only one sex chromosome, referred to as X.**

- Males only have one X chromosome (X0), while females have two (XX)

- Maternal gametes always contain an X chromosome,
	- So the sex of the offspring is decided by the male
	- Sperm contains either one X chromosome or no sex chromosomes at all

In a variant of this system, certain animals are hermaphroditic with two sex chromosomes (XX) and male with only one (X0)


##### Caenorhabditis elegans (see-no-rab-dite-iss) 
Transparent nematode (roundworm), about 1 mm in length. Lives in soil. 
- Has two sexes: 
	- Hermaphrodites and males
Individuals are almost all hermaphrodite, with males comprising just 0.05% of the total population

Hermaphrodite C. elegans have a matched pair of sex chromosomes (XX); the rare males have only one sex chromosome (X0)
They can deep freeze -> pull them out and they revive


 Males have only testes-  Hermaphrodites have testes and ovaries  Eggs produced in adult stage are self-fertilised  When self-inseminated, the worm will lay approximately 300 eggs

 Majority of offspring are hermaphrodites  Less than 1% of offspring are males 
 A mating between an adult male and a hermaphrodite produces half male and half hermaphrodite offspring 
	 When inseminated by a male, the number of offspring can exceed 1,000

It is believed the ratio of X chromsomes to the number of sets of autosomes determines the sex of C. elegans Ratio of 1.0 (2 X and 2 copies of each autosomes) = hermaphrodite (XX) Ratio 0.5 = male (X0
