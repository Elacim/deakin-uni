What critical piece of information should be kept in mind when describing a phylum's most basic characteristics? :: The characteristics apply to an embryonic stage. These may not be present or their presence may be significantly diminished in later life stages. (Information fully understood after reading [an article on Sea Squirts](https://movementum.co.uk/journal/sea-squirts))

Echinodermata etymology :: Spiny-Skin
Icthy meaning :: Fish

Which animal phylum is the most diverse? :: Arthropoda

As a snail crawls on a sea star, a jellyfish floats by, contained within a half-digested rat. A sea spider looks mournfully at it's lost prey not before sticking it's leg in a sponge. A leech is leeching off a flatworm.

What phylums are most closely grouped together? - Arthropoda
Echinodermata
Chordata
