## Anatomy
What do all Mollusca have in common? :: They all have hydrostatic skeletons, a muscular foot, a soft body, a hard structure covering their back known as the mantle cavity, and two pairs of nerves
What do most but not all Mollusca have in common? :: A hard shell. Some lose it during 
embryonic development.

What type of skeleton do molluscs have? :: All have hydrostatic skeletons and most also have an exoskeleton, or the shell
What are the shells of molluscs named as? :: Exoskeletons

What is the mouth of molluscs called? :: Radula
What is the radula? :: The mouth of molluscs

What is the underside of molluscs named? :: Muscular foot

What is the name for the piece of anatomy that holds a majority of a mollusc's organs and systems? :: The visceral mass 
What is another name for the 'visceral mass'? :: Visceral hump
What is the purpose of a mollusc's 'visceral mass'? :: [[Anatomy terms#Viscera|Viscera]], meaning a body's primary organs and systems, implies that visceral mass is a chamber for all of these parts.


What is the 'mantle' and what is the purpose of it? :: The mantle is a dorsally located part of molluscs that can secrete out a calcium carbonate shell, be used for movement, and always encloses the visceral mass 
What part of molluscs is used for shell secretion? :: The mantle
What part of molluscs encloses the visceral mass? :: The mantle

What is the 'mantle cavity' and what is the purpose of it? :: It is a cavity below the mantle that contains the molluscs sexual cell pores, gills (breathing), kidney-equivalent nephridiopore, and excretion
What part of molluscs hosts the gills? :: The mantle cavity
What part of molluscs excretes? :: The mantle cavity
