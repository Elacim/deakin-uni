## Skeletal Structure
Porifera used to be the name for this phylum, but it is now split into two. What are those two? ::  Calcarea ('of calcium') and Silicea ('of silicon')
 - meaning their skeletons/spicules are calcium carbonate/silica dioxide
What does 'Porifera' mean? :: 'Pore-bearer'
What does 'Calcarea' mean? :: 'Of calcium'
What does 'Silicea' mean? :: 'Of silicon'
What does 'of calcium' and 'of silicon' reference in regards to structure? :: It is about the composition of a Calcarea/Silicea's skeletal structure and/or their spinicules
Are Calcarea skeletons purely calcium? :: No, they are comprised of Calcium Carbonate ($CaCO_{3}$), a common mineral also found in rocks
Are Silicea skeletons purely silicon? :: No, they are comprised of Silicon Dioxide ($SO_{2}$), known also as silica

## Motility, environment, and more
Are sponges agile? :: No, they are sedentary animals
Where do sponges live? :: Within marine and freshwater environments
What is a sponge's symmetry? :: Asymmetrical
Do sponges have genders? :: They are hermaphroditic, meaning they have male and female parts and can fertilise itself
Do sponges have true tissues/organs? :: No. They only have cellular-level capabilities.
On what biological organisation level are the functions of sponges carried out? :: Cellular-level rather than tissue-level (Cell < Tissue < Organ etc.)

## Anatomy
What are the main anatomical features of a sponge? :: A wall with two layers, pores, the spongocoel, the osculum, choanocytes, and amoebocytes

What is the sponge wall comprised of? :: Pinacoderm cells (similar to epidermal layer), the gel matrix mesophyll, and finally choanocytes

What is the spongocoel? :: The main cavity of the sponge
What is the osculum? :: The hole at the top of the sponge that lets water flow out of the sponge
Where are the pores on sponges located? :: In the walls of the sponge, going from the outside to the spongocoel area
What is mesophyll and what is it's purpose? :: A gelatinous matrix that provides structural support 

What is the specialised cell used to generate water currents? :: Choanocytes with a flagella each

##### Choanocytes
What is a sponge's method of consuming food? :: Suspension/filter feeding. They suck in water using choanocytes and ingest the food

What is the purpose of choanocytes? :: By wagging it's flagellum, it creates eddies in the direction of the choanocyte, allowing food particles to ingested through phagocytosis by pores on the choanocyte

What is the structure of a choanocyte? :: A cell body, a net made of microvilli (collar filter), a flagellum, and though not part of it, an amoebocyte 
Where are Choanocytes located on a sponge? :: Being only on the inside of a sponge, they are peppered along the spongocoel 

What are the ingesting/digesting components of a choanocyte? :: The cell body ingests the food particles through phagocytosis, it can then digest it or move it onto it's totipotent amoebocyte friend

What is an amoebocyte? :: A totipotent cell that can construct skeletal structure components (spicules), or transport nutrients to other sponge cells
How do amoebocytes move? :: By extending their cell membrane (known as Pseudopodia)
