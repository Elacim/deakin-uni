#flashcards/classification/terms/symmetry 

What are the types of symmetry? :: Radial, bilateral, and asymmetrical

Radial symmetry :: Round around a central point (think anenome)
Benefits of radial symmetry :: All equal side can catch prey

Bilateral symmetry :: Cut along one plane gives a mirror image. Anterior and posterior axis
What would be an advantage of bilateral symmetry? :: Paired appendages allow movement to be easier (more in sync and consistent) than if it was radial or asymmetric

Asymmetric symmetry :: The lack of symmetry in any plane or rotation
