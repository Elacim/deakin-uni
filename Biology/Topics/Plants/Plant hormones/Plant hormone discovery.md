##### Late 1800s: Charles Darwin and Francis Darwin
How is phototropism (a plant's response to light) related to the discovery? :: Darwin and his son found that a grass seedling bent towards the light only if the tip of the coleoptile (protective sheathe) was present

What was Darwin and his son's theory on phototropism? :: That a signal came from the tip and spread to the elongating region

##### 1913: Peter Boysen-Jensen
What did he demonstrate? :: That the signal was a chemical substance that could move throughout the stem

The first and second stem shows a semi-permeable membrane (gelatin) being inserted into the tip and still curving
The third and fourth stem shows an impermeable membrane (mica) completely blocking plant hormones from traversal. 
The third demontrates by lack of curvature, that the hormones curve the non-lit side
The fourth shows that the more lit side is unaffected by the presence of mica.

##### 1926: Frits Went
What did he do? :: He extracted [[Auxins|auxin]] through modification of the Darwins and Boysen-Jensen's experiments

What did he prove? :: That bending stems are caused by an accumulation of auxin on the non-lit side, causing the non-lit cells to elongate
