How does the environment interact with the genotype? :: It affects the expressed genes, altering the displayed phenotype

What do hormones affect? :: Growth and development
What is growth defined as? :: A permanent increase in size and/or volume
What is development defined as? :: Sequential events dictated by precisely ordered genes

How do hormones primarily affect growth and development? :: They affect the division, elongation, and differentiation of cells

##### Reusability
Are hormones reusable? :: Yes. 
What is the effect of hormones being reusable? :: Only very low concentrations are needed to produce great effect.
##### Determinants of hormone gene expression
What can the gene expression of hormones be determined by? :: External environment factors

What are some external environmental factors affecting hormone gene expression? :: The levels of light, autumn, rain, the day/night cycle length.
