What do auxins do? :: Promote apical bud (main stem) development and inhibition of lateral stem development. This makes them an antithesis to [[Cytokinins]] in one way.

Does auxin have the same effect for any concentration? :: No, it can have the complete opposite effects in some cases like root growth

Do auxins affect cell development/differentiation? :: Yes, fruit development too. They can be considered similar to [[Cytokinins]] in this way.

- [[Abscission]] inhibition
- The formation of adventitious and lateral roots
- Apical dominance
- Cell differentiation

###### Prolonged/continued effects
Why would the effects be prolonged/continuous? :: The gene expression
Auxin effects on root growth at low concentrations :: It induces root growth
Auxin effects on root growth at high concentrations :: It inhibits root growth

How does auxin affect apical bud growth? :: It inhibits lateral growth, promoting apical dominance. Without the apical bud, lateral branches will grow.

#### Polar auxin transport
Why is it known as polar? :: Because it is unidirectional and goes from one pole (the apical) to the next (the basal)

Where does the auxin enter a cell? :: The apical end
Where does the auxin exit a cell? :: The basal end

How does auxin go from cell to cell? :: Through the cell wall of neighbouring cells, in through apical end

#### Cell elongation
Relevant: [[Plant hormone discovery#1926 Frits Went|Elongation (stem bending)]]

What is the leading theory of auxin causing cell elongation? :: The acid growth hypothesis
##### Acid growth hypothesis
Gist? :: Proton pumps in the plasma membrane are stimulated by auxin causing expansins to loosen the cell wall, allowing elongation
Why the odd name? :: Because the proton pump causes the cell wall pH to lower which triggers the expansin activation

What enzymes causes cell elongation? :: Expansins
What do expansins do? :: They allow the cellulose in the cell wall to loosen
