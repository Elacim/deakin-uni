Abscisic acid shorthand :: ABA

What is the main purpose of abscisic acid? :: To inhibit growth
What hormones does abscisic acid contradict? :: [[Cytokinins]], [[Auxins]], and [[Gibberellins]]

What environmental condition causes abscisic acid to be produced? :: Water stress/drought
What role does abscisic acid play in droughts? :: It increases tolerance by closing the stomata

Why would abscisic acid inhibit growth? :: It allows optimal conditions to be found before germination
What would an organism without an ABA-gene cause? :: Premature (precocious) germination. This occurs unintentionally in a corn mutant.

What organism intentionally produces low levels of ABA and why? :: The red mangrove. The precocious germination that follows allows it's dagger-like seeds to penetrate into the mud.
