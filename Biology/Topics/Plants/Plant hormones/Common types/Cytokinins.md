What are the cytokinins control?
(hint: It's a lot of things)
?
- Induce cytokinesis (also known as cell division)
- Slowing of aging and organ degradation
- Cell division/differentiation
- Lateral bud development



How do cytokinins affect plant age? :: They slow it down (slow senescence)
How do cytokinins affect plant organ death? :: They slow it down (slow senescence)

Where are cytokinins involved in cell division/differentiation produced? :: In growing tissues
What role do cytokinins play in cell division? :: They control it
What role do cytokinins play in cell differentiation? :: They control it

How are cytokinins involved with bud development? :: They promote it, demonstrating an opposite effect of [[Auxins]]
