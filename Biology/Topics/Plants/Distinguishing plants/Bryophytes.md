Liverworts (Hepatophyta)
Hornworts (Anthocerophyta)
Mosses (Bryophyta)

What is the bryophyte vascular system like? :: It does not have one unlike vascular plants with their xylem/phloem
Can bryophytes be large? :: No, they do not have the structures (like a vascular system) for being large (or tall)

- can have a cuticle
- dessicant tolerant (dries in warm weather), meaning it can rehydrate easily

Gametophyte lives longer and larger than sporophyte
	Gameto = green
	Sporo = brown and depends on the gameto

Gametophyte structure :: Protonemata and the gametophore

They have rhizoids which root the gametophyte to a substrate
Rhizoids are psuedo-roots (non-true roots). These lack vascular tissues, preventing long-distance traversal of water/nutrients.


Gametophyte sperm shape :: Flagellated
	Swim through a film to fertilise egg
Where do sporophytes come from? :: The archegonia
Sporophyhte structure :: Foot, seta (stalk), and sporangium (capsule)
How are spores ejected? :: Through the peristome

Moss
	Gamete: Green and photosynthesises
	Sporo: Green and photo when young, brown when mature and spore-ready
Hornworts
	Gametes: ""
	Sporo: Grows to ~5cm; splits open to release spores
Liverworts
	Gametes: Liver-shaped
	Sporo: Palm-tree looking thing (rare)

Asexual reproduction in liverworts:
	Gemmae cups produce gemmae, which are asexually reproduced clones of the parent

### Importance of moss
Living environments :: Extreme environments, common in moist areas like forests/wetlands
Purpose :: Prevents erosion, some may retain nitrogen, moist bed for vascular plant germination, provides invertebrate habitat (and therefore food for animals like birds), nesting material for birds, some have antibiotic properties, useful bioindicator/monitor of environments, usually the first to establish themselves

Sphagnum (peat moss) contains partially decayed material (peat); helpful for fossil fuel formation; excellent preserver; excellent (and most efficient) carbon sink
