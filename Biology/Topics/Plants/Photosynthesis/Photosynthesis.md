Equation for photosynthesis :: $\ce{ 6CO2 + 6H2O -> 6O2 + C6H12O6 }$
What is the purpose of photosynthesis? :: To produce the energy-dense and structurally strong glucose
What are the products of photosynthesis known as? :: Photosynthates

What are the two stages of photosynthesis? :: The light reactions (photo) and the Calvin cycle (carbon fixation)
What happens during carbon fixation? :: Atmospheric $CO_{2}$ and products from the light reactions are combined (fixed) to synthesise glucose

In what type of cell are chloroplasts found? :: In mesophyll cells
Where do the light reactions take place? :: In chloroplast thylakoid membranes
What are the two types of reactions (light and non-light) named? :: The light-dependent reactions (light reactions) and the light-independent reactions (dark reactions/Calvin cycle)

What are the 'dark reactions'? :: The Calvin cycle

###### Products
What percentage of produced glucose is used for cellular respiration? :: Roughly 50% of glucose
