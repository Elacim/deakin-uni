How does $NADPH$ acquire it's cargo for use in the Calvin cycle? :: From the series of light reactions 
What provides $e^{-}$ to the Calvin cycle? :: The $NADPH$ cofactor
Where does the carbon come from used in the Calvin cycle? :: From atmospheric $CO_{2}$
How are $e^{-}$ used in the Calvin cycle? :: They are compiled together with a carbon-rich molecule to form sugars
What is another name for light-independent reactions? :: Dark reactions

Does the Calvin cycle *need* light? :: No, the cycle itself is light-independent
Can the Calvin cycle run forever without light? Why or why not? :: It is technically light-independent but it requires light-dependent products so it eventually needs those products to function

What is the main product of the Calvin cycle? :: The sugar glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P)

## Three phases
How many cycles must take place to gain 1 G3P? :: 3 cycles, fixing 3 $CO_{2}$

#### Carbon fixation
What is the enzyme catalyst for carbon fixation? :: Rubisco
How is $CO_{2}$ incorporated into the Calvin cycle? :: By rubisco catalysing the attachment of $CO_{2}$ to ribulose biphosphate (RuBP)

How does 

How is carbon fixation initiated? :: 

#### Reduction


#### Regeneration of $CO_{2}$ acceptor
