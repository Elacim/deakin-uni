Chlorophyll pigment colour(s) :: Green
	Different pigments on slide 21a (not assessable)
Carotenoids pigment colour(s) :: Red, yellow, and orange
Phycobilins pigment colour(s) :: Red and blue

Main photosynthetic pigment :: Chlorophyll $a$
What do accessory pigments do? :: Expand light spectrum absorbed or damaging levels of light

What do the accessory pigments chlorophyll *b, c, d* do? :: Broaden the spectrum of light for use in photosynthesis
What do the accessory pigments carotenoids do? :: Absorb damaging amounts of light that would damage chlorophyll

Pigments have double bonds - $e^{-}$ can be excited meaning it is in a higher energy state
	When going back to a stable state, photons come off and the 
	pigment fluoresces and releases heat

What happens when a pigment absorbs light? :: It becomes excited and unstable
What happens when an excited electron goes back to a ground state? :: It releases photon(s), known as fluorescence, and also heat
