What is the deciding factor in closing/opening stomata? :: The levels of $\ce{CO2}$ and water

How are stomata microfibrils aligned? :: Radially, meaning, going with the curve of the guard cell
![[Stomata - open and close.png|300]]
#### Closing
What hormone is responsible for stomata closing? :: [[Abscisic acid]]
Appearance of a open stomata :: Two flaccid guard cells with slightly wrinkly, closed lips
When do stomata (usually) close? :: At night, preventing gases from escaping the leaf
 
1. Guard cells close from $K^{+}$ ions being actively-transported across the vacuole membrane (**tonoplast**) and the guard cell membranes (**plasmalemma**) into adjacent cells
2. To match the concentration gradient, water follows, leaving the stomata flaccid


#### Opening
Appearance of a open stomata :: Two turgid guard cells, looking like swollen, open lips
When do stomata (usually) open? :: During the day
Why would stomata open in the day when this is prime water-loss time? :: The plant is actively photosynthesising and needs $\ce{CO2}$ to upkeep this

1. $\ce{K+}$ ions are actively-transported in to the guard cells
2. Water flows in to match the gradient, filling the guard cells
