What is a seed? :: A protective coating with nutrients for a plant embryo
Benefits? :: Can remain dormant till good conditions; can be transported long distances
How are seeds transported? :: Animal digestion or wind, ?water?

What is environmental (e.g. wind, water) pollination known as? :: Abiotic pollination
What is animal pollination known as? :: Biotic pollination
Purpose of seed dormancy :: Better location found and less competition with parent

All seed plants have:
- reduced gametophyte stages
- heterospory (2 sexes and sizes)
- Ovules
- Pollen

Seed structure
?
- Seed coat (2n)
- Endosperm (3n)
- Embryo (2n)

#### Development
When does an ovule turn into a seed? :: After double fertilisation
What does the ovary develop into? :: A fruit
