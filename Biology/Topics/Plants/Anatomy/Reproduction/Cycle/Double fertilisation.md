Why the name? :: Pollen grains contain two sperm which separately fertilise different parts of the embryo sac

How?
?
1. Pollen grain lands on stigma
2. Grain produces a pollen tube
3. Pollen tube extends down towards the ovary
4. Pollen tube discharges two sperm into the embryo sac, fertilising the egg and polar nuclei

What do the two sperm fertilise?
?
1. One fertilises the egg
2. The other the polar nuclei (forming the triploid endosperm)

Result :: Development of a [[Seeds|seed]] per ovule and a fruit from the ovary containing all seeds
