What does a plant embryo contain? :: A root and a shoot with apical meristems
What develops into seeds? :: The ovules
What develops into a fruit? :: The ovary
What develops at the same time as seeds? :: Fruits

	- radicle/embyronic root emerges
	- Shoot top breaks through soil
	- Most eudicots: 
		- Hook forms in hypocotyl
		- Hook pushed above ground
			- Hook straighened then cotyledons and shoot tip pulled up
	- Most monocots:
