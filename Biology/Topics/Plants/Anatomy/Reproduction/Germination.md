What initiates seed germination? :: The entrance of water causing gibberellins to be released

How is germination triggered? :: Many sources like water, light changes, fire etc.
Imbibition :: The uptake of water due to low water concentration in a seed
What does germination rely on? :: Imbibition

What is the aleurone? :: The endosperm's thin outer layer
Endosperm becomes triploid after fertilisation before splitting

What occurs when water is absorbed by a seed? :: Gibberellins are released, sending signals to the aleurone


What does the aleurone do when activated? :: Digestive enzymes are synthesised and secreted which hydrolyse nutrients
What is an important nutrient that is hydrolysed by aleurone-secreted digestive enzymes? :: $\alpha$-amylase

What structure absorbs nutrients? :: The cotyledon

What is the scutellum? :: The barley seed equivalent of a cotyledon
