How do water and other dissolved substances move into the xylem? :: Through the endodermis
What is the endodermis? :: The innermost layer of cortex

What are the three types of water traversal? :: Apoplastic, symplastic, and transcellular
What is the apoplastic route? :: The traversal of water through cell walls
What is the symplastic route? :: The traversal of water through [[Protoplast]] to protoplast via plasmodesmata
What is the transcellular route? :: The traversal of water from cell vacuole to cell vacuole

In what direction is water taken up from? :: It is primarily pulled up

What is the primary force behind xylem water transportation? :: pullin'
What proves that water is pulled from the top? :: It occurs in cut stems where no roots are, meaning it must be pulled from the top
#### Water pull
What is adhesion in terms of water? :: Sticking to cell wall
What is cohesion in terms of water? :: Water sticking to itself
What is the traversal of water up through a small tube like the xylem called? :: Capillary action, which is modelled from the cohesion/adhesion theory
How does adhesion help water go up the xylem? :: It adheres to the walls of the xylem which counteracts gravity
How does cohesion help water go up the xylem? :: The water molecules follow suite, meaning that when one goes, a whole string of water molecules goes too

Air has less water than leaf tissue (water from leaf -> air)
Cohesion-adhesion theory
	Water is cohesive (lagging molecules will follow leading)
	Water adheres to xylem walls, counteracting gravity
	#question zero-grav on plants, does this make trees not work?
Water potential 

What is a requirement for water pull? :: The water potential in the roots needs to be lower than the soil

Symbol for water potential :: $\Psi$ 
Rough soil water potential :: $-0.3 \text{ MPa }\Psi$
Rough trunk xylem water potential :: $-0.6 \text{ MPa }\Psi$ (lowers as it goes up)
Rough leaf cell wall water potential :: $-1.0 \text{ MPa }\Psi$
Rough leaf air space potential :: $-7.0 \text{ MPa }\Psi$
Rough outside air water potential :: $-100.0 \text{ MPa }\Psi$
Why does water go from the leaf to the air? :: The air has a significantly lower water potential ($\Psi$) than leaves - $-100\Psi \text{ vs } -7\Psi$

#### Root pressure
Where does root pressure come from? :: The osmosis of water into the xylem due to mineral accumulation
What does root pressure cause? :: The pushing up of water and minerals through the xylem
Downsides of root pressure :: It is least effective during the day ()
Why is root pressure least effective during the day? :: Due to the great rate of transpiration
When is root pressure most effective? :: During low transpiration (typically night)

What is the highest measured root pressure (in metres)? :: 6.87 metres 
Do all plants utilise root pressure? :: Many don't, which includes the complete absence such as in conifers
