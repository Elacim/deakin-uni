[[Week 9b - Notes]]
Transpiration :: The evaporation of water from leaves/roots/flowers
What is the main factor in the rate of transpiration? :: The stomata opening and closing

Rate of transpiration is directly affected by closing/opening of stomata
	Transpiration doubles every 10C rise
		Evaporation cools surface
			So leaf may be ~5C vs ambient being 10C
	Humidity
		High/increase
			Less water loss
	Air
		More wind = less water around leaf = less transpiration (humidity-dependent)

Increase in $CO_{2}$: stomata close, decrease: open
Increase in light: stomata open, decrease close
Temperature: 10-25C: little effect, high temps: stomata cloes
	low temps? #question
Low water (water stress/high transpiration): stomata close 
CAM plants open stomata ?? #question
Hormones (Abscisic acid (ABA)) increase = close
Biological clock

##### Casparian strip
Suberised meaning :: A thing with a fatty substance
What is the Casparian strip? :: A water-impervious, fatty layer
Where is the Casparian strip located? :: Within the endodermis
What is the purpose of the Casparian strip? :: It forces apoplastic-routed water to cross the endodermis plasma membrane
Why would the Casparian strip force water a certain way? :: So the endodermis can control water entry to the xylem

What is the apoplast? :: Extracellular fluids that flows freely between cells

Why can't fluid through the apoplast flow directly into the xylem/vascular cylinder? :: It needs to be controlled so water entry can be regulated. Think of the apoplast flow turning into symplastic flow

##### Synergistic effects
How would light affect transpiration?
?
1. It would cause photosynthesis rates to increase
2. Causing a decrease in $\ce{CO2}$
3. $\ce{K+}$ ions increase, causing the stomata to open
4. Plant loses too much water (water stress)
5. The stomata closes

How would an increase in water stress affect transpiration?
?
1. The hormone ABA would increase
2. Causing the stomata to close


How would an increase in temperature affect transpiration?
?
1. Respiration would increase
2. Causing an increase in $\ce{CO2}$
3. The stomata closes
