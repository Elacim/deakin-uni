What natural phenomenon decides where sap is transported? :: Positive to negative pressure flow

During sugar loading, what type of transport is used? :: Active transport (uses ATP)
Why is active transport during sugar loading? :: The concentration of solute is high

1. Active loading of sugar

2. The high concentration of sugar causes the xylem to osmose water into the phloem
	1. This causes a positive pressure, forcing the sap to move to regions of low concentration

3. The sap flows to the low concentration area

4. The sugar is unloaded into the cell(s) with the low solute concentration

5. The now low concentration sap allows water to osmose back to the xylem


In sugar sinks, cells actively transport solutes out of the sieve-tube elements, producing the exactly opposite effect. The gradient of sugar from source to sink causes pressure flow through the sieve tube toward the sink.
