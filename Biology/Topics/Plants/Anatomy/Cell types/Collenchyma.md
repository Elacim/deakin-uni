**Collenchyma** - Living cells with uneven walls that interlock and weave to provide flexible support for plant structures, forming a tissue. 

How can collenchyma be remembered? :: *Kolla-enchyma*, meaning *support-tissue*

Are collenchyma flexible? :: Yes. They elongate to accommodate the structures they support
What purpose do collenchyma have? :: They help support the growing parts of the plant shoot (not the matured sections)
What part of the plant do collenchyma exist at? :: Young sections of the plant shoot for structural support like the [[Plant terms#Petiole|petioles]] or stems

What do collenchyma support? :: Stems and leaves

What is the thickness of collenchyma like? :: They have thicker primary walls than parenchyma though the thickness is inconsistent

How are collenchyma grouped? :: In cylindrical strands with very few intracellular spaces

Are collenchyma alive at maturity? :: Yes
