![[Tissue-cell types (Paren, Collen, Sclerenchyma).webp]]

**Parenchyma** - Unspecialised and easily adaptable living cells that perform many critical function of plants, including photosynthesis, forming a tissue
**Collenchyma** - Living cells with uneven walls that interlock and weave to provide flexible support for plant structures, forming a tissue
**Sclerenchyma** - Non-living cells with thick walls that can be fibres or varying round shapes that provide rigid support for plant structures, forming a tissue

What are parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma all examples off? :: The differentiated plant cell types. They are also the names of tissues.

What does '-enchyma' refer to? :: Technically translating from the Greek for *infusion*, it refers to a cellular tissue
How can parenchyma be remembered? :: *Para-enchyma*, meaning *beside-tissue*. It can be thought of as a filler tissue.
How can collenchyma be remembered? :: *Kolla-enchyma*, meaning *support-tissue*
How can sclerenchyma be remembered? :: *Sclero-enchyma*, meaning *hard-tissue*


You can grow an entire plant from what kind of cell? :: A parenchyma cell
What is the flesh part of fruit (usually) made of? :: Parenchyma cells

What plant cell is the least specialised? :: [[Parenchyma]]
