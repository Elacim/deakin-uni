Sugar sources :: The producer of sugars
Sugar sink :: The store/consumer of sugars given by phloem

| Source                  | Sink                              |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Photosynthesis (leaves) | Developing fruits/flowers         |
| Storage (starch)        | Meristems (roots/shoots)          |
|                         | Cellulose production              |
|                         | Non-photosynthetic structures     |
|                         | Storage structures (tubers/bulbs) |


Why are tubers/bulbs, food storage (i.e. a sink), also considered a source? :: They can break apart their starches, acting as a source

What are the primary sugar sources? 
?
- Photosynthesis from leaves
- Storage
