? :: Rhythmic behaviour

Where is it suspected to come from? :: Some sort of feedback loops originating from molecular mechanisms, possibly there are 'clock' genes 
Effect on temperature on the biological clock :: There is very little change, unlike other metabolic processes

Lengths :: Any length, usually diurnal (daily), seasonal, annual, etc.

How is the time of year determined? :: By the [[Photoperiod|photoperiod]]

Environmental cues being hidden do NOT affect the biological clock unless for extended periods of time
