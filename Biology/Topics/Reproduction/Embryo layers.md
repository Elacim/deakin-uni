### Diploblasts
What does the ectoderm form in diploblasts? :: The epidermis and muscular cells
What does the endoderm form in diploblasts? :: Various epithelial linings in the digestive tract
What does the mesoderm form in diploblasts? :: Nothing, as there is no mesoderm. The rough equivalent, mesoglea, is not cellular and does not form cellular content

### Names
What is the name for the outer layer of the embryo? :: The ectoderm
What is the name for the middle layer of the embryo? :: The mesoderm
What is the name for the inner layer of the embryo? :: The endoderm

Ecto meaning :: Outer
Meso meaning :: Middle
Endo meaning :: Inner
### General
In general, what is the ectoderm layer of the embryo responsible for? :: The outer layer of the skin and it's constituents, the nervous system, the hormone-producing adrenal medulla and pituitary gland, the mouth bones, and germ cells

In general, what is the mesoderm layer of the embryo responsible for? :: The inner parts of the body - the skeleton, muscles, circulatory, lymphatic, reproductive, and excretory being the primary. It also provides the middle layer of the skin (dermis) and the outer layer of the adrenal gland

In general, what is the endoderm layer of the embryo responsible for? :: The epithelial lining of organs, tubes, and ducts, the thymus, thyroid-related glands
