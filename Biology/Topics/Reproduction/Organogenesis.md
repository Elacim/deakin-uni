What stage comes before organogenesis? :: Gastrulation
What is this image of and what are these two lines pointing at in this image? ![[Organogenesis - Neural fold question.png|100]] :: This is a neural plate and the lines are pointing at the plate's neural folds

What are neural crest cells? :: Multipotent stem cells that form many structures like teeth and nerves
# Neurulation
What are the outcomes of neurulation? :: A foundation for further development of the brain and spinal cord
What is an optional condition of neurulation that vertebrates fulfil and invertebrates don't? :: Genes encoding for a spinal cord
What part of the embryo briefly looks like an opened book? :: The neural plate/folds just before finishing neural tube formation

What are the names for the steps in neurulation? :: Neural plate formation, neural tube formation, and somite formation
### Neural plate formation
What is the notochord? ::: What describes "a rod of cells that goes across the embryo's dorsal side"
Where does the notochord originate from? :: The dorsal mesoderm 
What does the notochord form? :: The spinal column

Where does the neural plate originate from? :: The dorsal ectoderm
How is the neural plate formed? :: The dorsal ectoderm is signalled to thicken up from surrounding cells (including the notochord), which is now named the neural plate
What are the components of the neural plate? :: An indent and two ridges (neural folds) comprised of ectodermal cells; the ridges have a border which later become neural crest cells
On the neural plate, where are the neural folds located? :: They are the lateral edges (to both sides of the indent)
Where are neural crest cells found on the neural plate? :: Their early form is found on the border of the neural plate, beyond the folds 

### Neural tube formation
From what structure does the neural tube originate from? :: The neural plate
How does the neural tube come about? :: The neural folds pinch together, creating a tube below it

What lies above the neural tube? :: The ectoderm and briefly, neural crest cells 
What lies below the neural tube? :: The notochord
Where do neural crest cells relocate to? :: The sides of the neural tube

### Somite formation
What are 'somite'? :: Mesoderm-generated cellular blocks 
How are somite arranged? :: Along the posterior and anterior axis
What is the purpose of somite? :: To organise segmented structures in vertebrate embryos
Where are the somite come from? :: They come from mesodermal cells located to the sides of the notochord
Where are the somite located? :: To the side of the notochord

Do the lungs stem from somite? :: No
Do the ribs stem from somite? :: Yes
Does the skeleton stem from somite? :: No
Do skeletal muscles derive from somite? :: Yes, a significant portion at least
Do spine vertebrae stem from somite? :: Yes
What part of the skin derives from somite? :: The dorsal dermis skin (on an embryo's back)

What new structures are formed by the mesoderm lateral to the notochord separating? :: The coelom tissue lining
