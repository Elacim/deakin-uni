What can the vast, vast majority of animals be likened to in terms of the resulting shape? :: Most animals are built like a tube acting as a digestive tract with bits around the tube complementing it

What is a Protosome? ::: The term for an animal whose mouth develops from the blastopore before it's anus
What is a Deuterosome? ::: The term for an animal whose anus develops from the blastopore first, developing a mouth later
What is a Triplobast? ::: The term for an animal who has *three* distinct layers of cells during embryonic development
What is a Diploblast? ::: The term for an animal who has *two* distinct layers of cells and a middle jelly layer (the mesoglea) during embryonic development

What is a basic overview of embryonic development? :: Zygote -> Morula -> Blastula -> Gastrula -> Full embryo
What is the general term used when referring to any or all of the embryo layers? :: The germ layers

After fertilisation and a few cellular divisions, what is the resulting shape of the embryo? :: A raspberry. It is a ball of cells called a Morula.

At what stage does the fertilisation envelope dissipate? :: Post-blastula, so likely in the Gastrula stage

What enzyme is commonly used to detect in early pregnancy tests? ::: Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCP) is used for this

When do cells begin to differentiate? :: During the cell movement in gastrulation

Slide 3a, Week 2b
• Cell division -> different cells -> different environments
• Differential gene expression -> cell differentiation
• Differential morphogenesis
Morphogenesis :: The developing of the shape of cell distributions
#### Morula
What is the process of cleavage? :: The zygote subdivides many times, not forming new mass, but spreading out the mass into new cells, known as blastomeres
