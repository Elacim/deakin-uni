What is the process of reaching the gastrula stage named? :: Gastrulation
What is invagination? :: The folding in of a part of an organism's anatomy for the purpose of creating a cavity
In overview, what happens in the Gastrula stage? :: A single section of the ball of cells, roughly the centre, invaginates, forming the blastopore. This continues to invaginate until it reaches the other pole, the animal pole.

What is the blastopore? ::: The location where cells will relocate from the surface to the inside 
Where does the blastopore form? :: On a random side of the blastula in roughly the centre
What is the purpose of the cell migration inwards? :: To form three separate layers, each controlling the development of many functions of the body

What is the archenteron? ::: The simple digestive cavity formed within the gastrula

What process is exclusive to triploblasts that is done in gastrulation? :: The separation of the ecto and endoderm to form the mesoderm
What layer is dominant after gastrulation? :: The ectoderm
What layer is the yolk plug? :: The endoderm
After gastrulation, what are the external layers? :: The ectoderm and for the yolk plug, the endoderm

What happens to the blastocoel during gastrulation? :: It shrinks until it gives way and disappears to the archenteron and endoderm
What does the archenteron and endoderm replace during/after gastrulation? :: The blastocoel


Why do animals with a combined mouth and anus not have a separate mouth and anus? :: Because, in the Gastrula stage, the blastopore invaginates to a certain point and then proceeds to an unrelated step, whereas in separate mouth and anus animals, the blastopore invaginates until it reaches the other pole of the cell
