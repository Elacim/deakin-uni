#flashcards/reproduction/embryo/development/blastula 

What is the other name for blastula? :: The blastocyst

What is the outer layer of the blastocyst comprised of? :: Trophoblast cells that secrete fluid to form the blastocoel
Blastocyst components :: One or more layers of cells surrounding the blastocoel, which is a fluid-filled chamber, and the two ends of the embryo, the vegetal and animal pole

In overview, what happens in the Blastula/Blastocyst stage? :: The outer cells (trophoblasts) secrete fluid causing cells to be displaced to the outside, forming a 'hollow ball' of cells to be surrounding a fluid-filled cavity (blastocoel)


How is the size of the cell ball affected during the Blastocyst stage? :: It is unaffected as density is preferred to size at this point

###### Poles
Vegetal etymology :: 'animate', from the Latin 'vegetare'. The etymology is rather ironic as it is considered to be the less dynamic pole
Why is the animal pole named the animal pole? :: As it divides faster than the vegetal pole, it is considered more dynamic and therefore more like an animal 
What are the characteristics and components of the vegetal pole? :: It contains the larger, yolk-filled cells of the embryo that slowly divide and the blastocoel is furthest
What are the characteristics and components of the animal pole? :: The cells are smallest and densest here, the blastocoel is closest, contain little yolk, and are fast dividing 
To what part of the embryo is the blastocoel most closely located to? :: The animal pole
