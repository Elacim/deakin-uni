What is it made of? :: Muscle fibres parallel to each other
Roughly how many cells is a muscle fibre made of? :: One cell per fibre
Do muscle fibres contain lots of nuclei? :: Yes

What does each muscle fibre contain? :: Bundles of myofibrils

What causes muscle stripiness (striation) :: Alternating light and dark bands

What does each myofibril contain? :: Lots of sarcomeres
What are sarcomeres? :: 
Where are sarcomeres found? :: Between two Z-lines in myofibrils
What are Z-lines? :: Dark lines found in myofibrils, denoting sarcomere regions

What are the myofilaments? :: Thin actin and thick myosin
Myofibril (protein filaments) - thin filaments of actin/regulatory proteins
Thick filaments - myosin molecules
Actin :: Act-thin

Sarcomeres move past each other when contracting/relaxing
- the functional units of the muscle
- shorten when thin slide across thick towards sarcomere centre
- filament length stays the same

Rigomortis is caused by myosin heads not having any ATP to move

$Ca^{2+}$ ions can bind with the regulatory protein Troponin and bind to myosin binding sites to allow muscles to contract
	This process seems silly but it prevents random spasming

Muscles are stimulated by motor neuron cells releasing acetylcholine (ACH) 
- Sarcoplasmic reticulum (specialised ER in muscle cells)
	- Permeability shifts to release calcium ions

1 myofibril can be hundreds of thousands of sarcomeres spread over tens of cells
