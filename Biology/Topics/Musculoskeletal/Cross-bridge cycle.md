? :: The sliding of actin along myosin to contract or relax muscles
Other name :: Sliding filament theory

Energy level of the myosin head when bound to ATP :: Low-energy
What is the myosin head attached to in it's low energy-configuration? :: Myosin filament (structural support)
What is the myosin head attached to in it's high energy-configuration? :: Myosin filament (structural support) and bound to an actin site

## Overview
1. Myosin head starts bound to ATP (in low-energy configuration)
2. Myosin head hydrolyses ATP to use energy to be in high-energy configuration
	1. It is still bound to $\ce{ADP + PO4^{3-}}$
3. Myosin head binds to actin, forming the cross-bridge with actin
4. The $\ce{ADP + PO4^{3-}}$ are released and the myosin head power strokes to slide the actin along the myosin, towards the sarcomere centre
5. An $\ce{ATP}$ binds to the myosin, putting it back into low-energy configuration to start the cycle anew

###### Old but still correct info - The Cross Bridge Cycle
1. The head of a myosin molecule is bound to actin. 
2. The bond is broken when ATP binds to myosin 
3. ATP is broken down into ADP and P, and position of myosin head changes & binds to a new actin site, further along molecule (called a cross-bridge) 
4. Release of ADP and P from the myosin bends the myosin head and the molecules slide over one another (power stroke) 
• The cross-bridge is broken when a new ATP binds to the myosin head (1) 
• The process repeats in cycles
