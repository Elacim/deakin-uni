# Locus

Position of a gene on a chromosome

---
# Allele

Different form of a gene

---
# Phenotype

Physical expression of a gene and it's alleles.
An organism's observable appearance and/or observable/physiological traits (e.g. `Pp & PP` making two purple plants)

---
# Genotype

An organism's genetic makeup (e.g. `Pp & PP`)

---
# Trait

Each variant for a character, such as purple or white colour for flowers - the observable phenotype

---
# Polygenic

One characteristic is controlled by two or more genes

---
# Homozygous

*Homozygote, pure breed*

1. Having the same alleles at a particular gene locus on homologous chromosomes. 
2. Of an organism in which both copies of a given gene have the same allele. 
3. Having identical alleles at corresponding chromosomal loci.

---
# Homozygote

An organism that is homozygous for a character

---
# Heterozygous

*Heterozygote*

1. Having different alleles at one or more corresponding chromosomal loci. 2. Of or relating to a heterozygote. 
3. Of an organism which has two different alleles of a given gene.

---
# Hybridisation

The breeding of two true breeding organisms (e.g. `PP x pp`) to create a hybrid (`Pp`)

---
# monohybrid

One gene, two alleles
Always results in a 3:1 ratio

---
# Dihybrid

Two genes, each with two alleles
Always results in a 9:3:3:1
Can be considered as two monohybrid crosses for calculation sake (if the loci aren't linked)

---
# epistasis

*Epistasis*

Interactions between genes causing masking effects (one more dominant than the other) or new traits.
This influences the phenotype.

---
# semi-conserved

*semi-conservative*

Often used like 'semi-conserved DNA' or 'semi-conserved chromosomes'.

DNA, when replicated, is unzipped into it's two strands (both 'old'). Each of these old strands gathers nucleotides, forming a new DNA strand on the old. When the old and new combine, the end result is a complete DNA strand and as there are two olds, there are two news and therefore two DNA strands.

---
# centromere

Heterochromatic region of a chromosome to which microtubule fibres attach during cell division
The centromere location gives a chromosome its characteristic shape

---
# homologous

In reference to homologous chromosomes, it is a chromosome with two identical chromatids.
