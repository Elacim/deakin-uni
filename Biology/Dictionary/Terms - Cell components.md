# Centrosome

*Centriole, Centrioles, Centrosomes*

Organelles comprised of two centrioles that organise mitotic spindle.
They also determine the positions of the nucleus and other organelles.

---
# Kinetochore

A complex of plates of proteins found at the centromere region used as a point for chromosome manipulation by spindle fibres (microtubules)

---
# Histones

*Histone*

A major protein component of nucleosomes that binds DNA into tight bundles

---
# Nucleosomes

*nucleosomes*

8 histones bound together with chromatin fibres (DNA strands known linking DNA)

---
# Chromosomes

*chromosomes*

Tightly packed structures comprised of nucleosomes (histones connected by chromatin)

---
# Chromatin

*chromatin*


Loosely wound genetic material

---

# Euchromatin

The less condensed form of chromatin available for transcription and for repairing DNA

---
# Heterochromatin

The highly condensed form of chromatin that appears during interphase, and is generally not transcribed

---
# Chiasma

 The physical site of chromatids crossing over

---
# exonuclease

Exonucleases are enzymes that work by cleaving nucleotides one at a time from the end of a polynucleotide chain.
