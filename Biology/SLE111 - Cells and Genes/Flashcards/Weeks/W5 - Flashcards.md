# Cellular respiration
What triggers anaerobic respiration over aerobic respiration within an animal cell? :: When the body's oxygen demand is unable to be met. A mature red blood cell (RBC) has no [[Mitochondria]] and only undergoes glycolysis
<!--SR:!2023-07-30,3,250-->
Cellular respiration harvests energy from {{organic molecules}} :: Organic molecules (glucose)
<!--SR:!2023-07-30,3,250-->
Cellular respiration simplified formula :: $C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + 6O_{2} \xrightarrow{\text{Cellular respiration}} 6CO_{2} + 6H_{2}O + \text{energy (heat + 32-36ATP)}$ 
Where does cellular respiration occur? :: Glycolysis (anaerobic respiration) occurs within the [[Cytoplasm]]. The further steps (Kreb's Cycle and Electron Transport Chain) occur within the [[Mitochondria]]
After photosynthesis, what happens to the waste products? :: Some are expelled like $O_{2}$, but others like $CO_{2} \text{ and } H_{2}O$ are directly reused in further photosynthesising

Redox reaction :: Reduction-oxidation reaction. Chemical reactions that gain/lose electrons or electron density levels from one substance to another
Redox reaction example :: $C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}+6O_{2} \rightarrow 6CO_{2}+6H_{2}O$. Glucose oxidises, losing it's electrons and hydrogens while the 6 oxygens reduce, gaining glucose's lost electrons and hydrogens
Redox shorthand: If a $C$-containing molecule gains $H$s or loses $O$, it's likely been {{reduced}} :: Reduced
Redox shorthand: If a $C$-containing molecules loses $H$s or gains $O$, it's likely been {{oxidised}} :: Oxidised [Source - Khan Academy ('Intro to cellular respiration')](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/cellular-energetics/cellular-respiration-ap/a/intro-to-cellular-respiration-and-redox) 
How is $2H_{2} + O_{2} \rightarrow 2H_{2}O + \text{Heat}$ a redox reaction? :: Due to $O$'s higher $\chi$, it hogs electrons more. $O$ has a higher electron *density* than previously (reduction) while $H$ has a lower density
Oxidation :: Loss of electrons or electron density during a chemical reaction
Reduction :: Gain of electrons or electron density during a chemical reaction
OIL RIG :: **O**xidation **I**s **L**oss, **R**eduction **I**s **G**ain
Oxidation is {{loss}}, Reduction is {{gain}} :: Loss; Gain
The more electronegative ($\chi$) an atom is means it's electrons are higher in energy :: False. The more electronegative means it's electrons are lower in energy

### Glycolysis
Glycolysis meaning :: 'Glyco' meaning 'sugar', '-lysis' meaning break down. Glycolysis therefore means 'breaking down sugars'
Glycolysis location :: [[Cytoplasm]]
Glycolysis starting molecules :: Glucose; $2 ATP$
Glycolysis produced molecules :: $2ATP; 2 H_{2}O; 2NADH + 2H^{+}$; $2$ pyruvate
Glycolysis summary :: Anaerobic reaction. Breaks glucose in half using 2 ATP, net profit of 2 ATP. $2NAD^{+} + 4e^{-} + 4H^{+}$ turns into $2NADH + 2H^{+}$
Pyruvate purpose :: Converted to Acetyl-CoA, before going down either [[Aerobic and Anaerobic]] respiration (i.e. Kreb's cycle or lactic acid fermentation). 
Glycolysis ATP generation :: 2 $ATP$

### Acetyl-CoA formation
Acetyl-CoA formation location :: [[Mitochondria]] matrix
Acetyl-CoA formation starting molecules :: Pyruvic acid

Pyruvate oxidation :: The conversion of pyruvate into Acetyl-CoA
Acetyl-CoA composition :: An acetyl group, a ribose, 2 phosphate groups, and 1 adenine group. The 2 phosphate and 1 adenine are the basis for an $ADP$ molecule.

### Citric Acid Cycle
What is happening in each step of the citric acid cycle (not specifics) :: Chemical reactions controlled by enzymes

Electron Transport Chain 'energy steps' meaning :: $NADH$ and $FADH_{2}$'s electrons each have an associated energy level. By undergoing redox reactions, this energy level can lower in steps in order to reach a more stable state. Each of these steps releases energy, allowing ATP to be synthesised 
Electron Transport Chain summary :: 1. ETC pumps $H^{+}$ into intermembrane; 2. $H^{+}$ gradient, lowering pH of matrix (chemiosmosis); 3. $H^{+}$ re-enters, releasing energy to produce $ATP$
ETC ATP generation :: ~26-28 $ATP$

Proton pumps  :: Complexes I, III, and IV (also known as proton pumps). When electrons move down an energy level (energetically downhill), the proton pumps capture this energy and use it to pump $H^{+}$ ions against the electrochemical gradient (matrix -> intermembrane space)
How do electrons flow between complexes? :: Using the CoQ (within membrane) and Cytochrome C (embedded on outside of membrane) molecules. Each complex has a greater affinity for electrons than the last
ETC complex names :: Complexes I-IV 
ETC complex general purpose :: To accept electrons and pump $H^{+}$ ions from the matrix into the intermembrane state, creating a proton-motive force which is then used to synthesise ATP

##### Energy shuttles
Energy shuttles ::: A molecule that transports $e^{-}$, such as $NADH$
What are $NADHD$ and $FADH_2$? :: Electron-carrying coenzymes; energy shuttles
$NAD^{+}$ :: Oxidised form of $NADH$ (lost $e^{-}$). It will readily accept electrons. 
$NADH$ :: Reduced form of $NAD^{+}$  (gained $2e^{-}$ and $1H^{+}$). In anaerobic respiration, it donates this electron to pyruvate, generating lactic acid and $NAD^{+}$. Within aerobic, they donate to intermediates within the Kreb's Cycle 
[Source - LibreTexts - ("Fermentation and the regeneration of NAD+")](https://bio.libretexts.org/Courses/University_of_California_Davis/BIS_2A%3A_Introductory_Biology_(Easlon)/Readings/09.3%3A_Fermentation_and_Regeneration_of_NAD)
How many $H^{+}$ ions can $NADH$ facilitate pumping; how about ATP? :: ? ions, 3.5 ATP
$FAD$ :: Oxidised form of $FADH_{2}$ (lost $e^{-}$)
$FADH_{2}$ :: Reduced form of $FAD$ (gained $e^{-}$ and $2H^{+}$) 
How many $H^{+}$ ions can $FADH_{2}$ facilitate pumping; how about ATP? :: ? ions, 2.5 ATP

What is the role of $NADH$ and $FADH_{2}$ in the context of cellular respiration? :: Being electron carriers, they take electrons from Glucose in Glycolysis and from the products/intermediates in the Krebs cycle. Using these electrons, they power the Electron Transport Chain complexes to pump $H^{+}$ ions. This regenerates (oxidises) them, allowing them to be reused in glycolysis and the Krebs cycle.

What happens when $NADH$ accumulates? :: It must be regenerated into $NAD^{+}$ through lactic acid fermentation (pyruvate + $NADH \rightarrow$ $NAD^{+}$ + Lactic acid)
Why does $NAD^{+}$ turn into $NADH$ instead of simply $NAD$ when reduced? :: When it gains an electron, it then has a net negative charge. Due to it being in water, a $H$ atom from a $H_{2}O$ molecule balances out the $NAD$ into $NADH$

Why does $FADH_{2}$ and $NADH$ result in different amounts of ATP? :: $NADH$ has higher energy electrons then $FADH_{2}$, allowing more proton pumping to be done with fewer electrons

Final electron acceptor in anaerobic respiration :: $NAD^{+}$. $NAD^{+} \rightarrow NADH$ 
Final electron acceptor in aerobic respiration :: $O_{2}$. $O + 2H^{+} \rightarrow H_{2}O$
Are $FADH_{2}$ and $NADH$ electron acceptors in their reduced form? :: Yes. They are currently carrying electrons. $FAD/NAD^{+}$ are their oxidised forms.
Are $FAD/NAD^{+}$ in their reduced forms? :: No, they are in their oxidised forms. $FADH_{2}/NADH$ are their reduced forms (they are carrying electrons)

How long can muscles run aerobically? :: Roughly 15 seconds
What other molecules can cellular respiration use? :: Diverse group of Carbohydrates; Fats; Proteins
What must proteins and amino acids go through before being used in cellular respiration? :: Proteins are broken down into amino acids, then the amino acids may be converted to glucose within the liver
What happens to molecules made in cellular respiration? :: They can be reused. Glycolysis and Kreb's are 'metabolic interchanges' 
What stage produces the most $CO_{2}$? :: Kreb's Cycle (1 Acetyl-CoA = $2CO_{2}$)
