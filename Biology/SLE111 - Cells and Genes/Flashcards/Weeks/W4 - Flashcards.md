## Cell regulation
In cell stages, what checkpoint names? :: $G_{1}, G_{2}, \text{and } M$ (spindle checkpoint from metaphase-anaphase) [Source - Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/cell-communication-and-cell-cycle/regulation-of-cell-cycle/a/cell-cycle-checkpoints-article)
How do cell checkpoints generally work? :: Internal and external cues (e.g. DNA damage or not enough resources) trigger signalling pathways, activating or inactivating a set of core proteins that move the cell cycle forward
What happens at the $G_{1}$ checkpoint? ::: The cell checks if it is large enough for division; has enough nutrient and energy reserves; is receiving positive cues (such as growth factors) from neighbours; and is any of the DNA damaged
What happens at the $G_{2}$ checkpoint? ::: The cell checks for any DNA damage and the completeness of DNA replication. Repairs or attempts to complete the DNA are made. If irreparable, apoptosis is on the table to prevent malformed cells and cancer. 
What happens at the $M$ (spindle) checkpoint? ::: Between metaphase and anaphase, the cell checks that 2+ of the mitotic/meiotic spindles are attached to the chromosomes by looking for 'straggler' chromosomes floating in the [[Cytoplasm]]. Mitosis is paused until the spindle catches misplaced chromosomes. This is due to sister chromatid separation in Anaphase being irreversible. 

What happens if a cell is not ready to go to the next stage of the cell cycle? :: The cell will be put into a dormant, hibernation state (known as $G_{0}$) either until conditions are suitable, a internal or external signal can trigger the cell to start division  
What protein controls cell checkpoints? :: Cyclin proteins binding to $CdK$s
What do cyclin-dependent kinases ($CdK$) enzymes depend on to activate? ::: They depend on Cyclin to activate
What would happen to a non-dividing cell if cyclin-dependent kinases ($CdK$s) were introduced to it? :: It would go ahead with division
Kinases :: Enzymes that attach a phosphate group (phosphorylate)

Multiple $CdK$ bound to it's $M$-cyclin partner :: Maturation-Promotion Factor 
Maturation-Promotion Factor (MPF) :: Cyclin-$CdK$ complex that activity increases with cyclin levels; activated by a phosphatase, removing an inhibitory previously added phosphate group [Source - Wikipedia - 'MPFs'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maturation_promoting_factor)
Maturation-Promotion Factor (MPF) purposes :: Stimulates mitosis/meiosis through phosphorylating multiple necessary proteins; stimulates cell growth and division [Source - Wikipedia - 'MPFs'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maturation_promoting_factor)

## Cancer
Growth factor dependence :: 1/3 factors a normal cell must exhibit. A cell's dependence on a growth factor signalling a cell to grow 
Anchorage dependence :: 1/3 factors a normal cell must exhibit. The anchoring of a cell to a surface.
Density-dependence inhibition :: 1/3 factors a normal cell must exhibit. A normal cell's division inhibition when densely packed or a single layer of cells exist.
What three factors is cancer missing compared to a regular cell? :: 1. Growth factor dependence; 2. anchorage dependence; 3. density-dependence inhibition
What effect occurs when growth factor dependence is not followed? :: Uncontrolled cellular growth and division, potentially leading to a cancerous growth (tumour)
What effect occurs when anchorage dependence is not followed? :: A cell is unbound to a surface, allowing it to traverse to locations it does not belong in
What effect occurs when density-dependence inhibition is not followed? :: A cell will continue to divide regardless of cellular density in the area, potentially leading to a cancerous growth (tumour)

# [[Metabolism]]
What is metabolism? :: The totality of an organism's anabolic and catabolic chemical reactions
Cells are bags of... :: Chemical reactions
Anabolism :: The **synthesising** of larger and more complex molecules **from** smaller ones, consuming energy in the process; think anabolic steroids (steroids=building up)
Catabolism :: The **breakdown** of large, complex molecules **to** smaller, simpler molecules, releasing energy in the process; think catastrophic (things are breaking down)
Are anabolic and catabolic reactions chemical reactions? :: Yes - they are both biochemical reactions, making up metabolism. They involve the synthesising and breaking apart of large molecules. Anabolic reactions **use** ATP and catabolic help **create** ATP

Anabolic reaction examples :: Proteins from amino acids; glycerol from glucoses; fats from fatty acids & glycerol; photosynthesis 
Catabolic reaction examples :: Glycerol into glucoses; glucose into pyruvate; digestion of food; cellular respiration

## Metabolic pathways
Metabolic pathway definition :: A series of connected anabolic or catabolic reactions initially fuelled with one or more molecules. These reactions result in intermediates which are further reacted with (using enzymes/the intermediates), eventually resulting in one or more products [Source - Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/cellular-energetics/cellular-energy/a/overview-of-metabolism) 
How are metabolic pathways controlled? :: Through one-way reactions controlled by enzymes
What is each product of a step in a metabolic pathway called? :: An intermediate. If an enzyme reacts with it, it is also called the substrate
What is the purpose of multiple steps within a metabolic pathway? :: It allows the enzyme and/or product to stay in it's shape. The final product may be fairly similar to the start reactant, so more steps helps reduce the chance of the product returning to a previous state. It is also necessary - it can't all be done in one step, ay.

### Feedback loops
Are negative or positive feedback loops more efficient? :: Negative feedback loops. They are tightly controlled by design - you have all the product you need? Halt production. Need more product? Start production up. This prevents resource wastage.

#### Negative feedback
Purpose of negative feedback loops :: Stops resource wastage; most efficient; sleek design; [[Homeostasis]]
Overview of negative feedback loop within the context of a metabolic pathway :: The end product of a metabolic pathway acts as an inhibitor of an enzyme at an earlier step within the pathway, this is known as feedback inhibition
When are negative feedback loops used? :: Within metabolic pathways, society (supply matches demand)

#### Positive feedback
Purpose of positive feedback loops :: To make a process reach completion (pregnancy, blood clotting)
Overview of positive feedback loops :: The production of a product stimulates further production of the product, i.e. they amplify an initial stimuli
When are positive feedback loops used? :: During pregnancy, contractions are powered by oxytocin, forcing the baby into the cervix, releasing more oxytocin; platelets release 1 or more of 13 clotting factors, aggregating further platelets to the area [Source - BioNinja](https://ib.bioninja.com.au/standard-level/topic-6-human-physiology/66-hormones-homeostasis-and/feedback-loops.html)

# Enzymes
What is an enzyme? :: An ultra-specific catalytic protein that alters a substrate, the result being called the product ![[Enzyme - activation energy with and without.png|200]]
Enzyme examples :: Lactase breaking down Lactose; Hexokinase breaking down glucose; Protease breaking down proteins; ATPase breaking down ATP; Polymerase building polymers; Lipase breaking down fats; Ligase forming bonds between two molecules
What is a substrate? :: A compound that an enzyme works on to form a product
Substrate examples :: Glucose; Glucose-6-phosphate
What is a catalyst? :: Matter or energy that speeds up a given reaction without being consumed. The reaction is sped up by lowering the activation energy ($E_{A}$) needed for a reaction to occur. All (known) enzymes are catalytic (but not all catalysts are enzymes)
Catalyst examples :: All enzymes; heat

Exergonic reaction :: Releases energy which is used in endergonic reactions; occurs spontaneously; 'ex' - 'exit' - energy exits
Exergonic reaction examples :: Cellular respiration $(H_{2}O + ATP \xrightarrow{hydrolosis} ADP + \text{ Energy} + P_i)$; iron rusting; combustion  
Endergonic reaction :: Requires energy; non-spontaneous; 'ender' - 'enter' - energy must enter
Endergonic reaction examples :: Photosynthesis; ATP synthesis $(\text{Energy} + ADP \rightarrow ATP)$; Glutamic acid to glutamine [Source - Libretexts](https://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/Brevard_College/CHE_301_Biochemistry/07%3A_Nutrition/7.06%3A_ATP_as_Energy_carrier)
What does ATP do to endergonic reactions? :: They make them exergonic
Energy coupling :: When the energy produced by one reaction (exergonic reaction) fuels another (endergonic reaction)

What do enzymes do to a substrate? :: They lower the activation energy ($A_{E}$) of it ![[Enzyme - activation energy with and without.png|200]]
How do enzyme active sites lower the activation energy ($A_{E}$) of a reaction? :: Via the active site directly or it's amino acid $R$ groups. It can: **1.** Act as a template for orientating a substrate; **2.** Stressing the substrate and stabilising the transition (post-substrate but pre-product) state; **3.** Providing a favourable environment; **4.** Direct participation in the catalytic reaction [[Week 4b - enzymes -exclude.pdf#page=9|Week 4b Powerpoint; Slide 9a]]
Enzyme naming scheme :: 
Primary suffixes of proteins :: '-ase' or 'ite'

Denatured protein properties :: Loss of function as a protein/enzyme; malformed active site [Source - Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/protein/Protein-denaturation)
Factors leading to enzyme denaturation :: Higher than optimal temperatures; pH; disruptive chemicals
Can you renature a denatured enzyme? :: Somewhat. It is not a guarantee. There is a class of proteins called *Chaperone Proteins* which help fold proteins and can restore proteins after *partial* denaturation [Source - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaperone_(protein))

Can any substrate match with an enzyme's active site? :: No. The enzyme's active site is like a lock and key, where it requires an exact match
Induced fit ::: An enzyme hugs the substrate so it can undergo transformation without leaving halfway through
How do induced fits 'hug' a substrate? :: Through 'weak interactions' like hydrogen or ionic bonds
Components that all enzymes have :: Active/Catalytic site
Name for an enzyme that does not need a cofactor :: Simple enzymes
Components that only some enzymes have :: Cofactors (e.g. pepsin, trypsin)
Enzyme components :: Active/Catalytic site; Coenzyme; 
Active site :: 

Are enzymes strictly necessary for reactions to occur? :: No. Without them, the reactions still can occur and provide the same results but with the caveat of requiring more input energy to activate. An enzyme simply lowers the activation energy ($A_{E}$)
Without enzymes, would life be able to function? :: Potentially, but likely not. Without enzymes lowering the activation energy of reactions, they either may not occur at all or fast enough to be able to sustain life [Source - AMFEP](https://amfep.org/about-enzymes/)

### Inhibition
Competitive inhibition :: The inhibitor, resembling the substrate, binds fully or partially to the active site, reversibly preventing the substrate from binding to the active site
Competitive inhibition examples :: Penicillin binding to a enzyme responsible for cell wall construction in certain bacteria; Methotrexate binding to a receptor, interfering with DNA synthesis and blocks division in rapidly dividing cancer cells 
Non-competitive inhibition :: The inhibitor binds to the enzyme, but not on the active site. It does alter the enzyme shape and therefore alters enzyme functionality
Non-competitive inhibition example :: Cyanide preventing aerobic respiration by binding to an enzyme in the [[Mitochondria]], leading to oxygen being unable to reduce to water 
Irreversible inhibition :: The inhibitor, resembling the substrate, forms covalent bonds between itself and the enzyme's active site, permanently destroying the enzyme's functionality
Irreversible inhibition example :: Nerve Gas continually activating an enzyme responsible for stopping muscles from contracting; Pesticides


### Co-factors
What are co-factors? :: Non-protein helpers (like $Cu, Zn, \text{ or } Fe$) for enzymes that bind to an enzymes active site temporarily or permanently
What are some common metal ions cofactors? :: $Cu, Zn, \text{ and } Fe$. They accept/donate electrons, altering the active site's charge
Co-factors are usually chemically neutral during reactions :: False, they are often chemically charged

##### Coenzymes
What are coenzymes? :: Cofactors that are organic molecules
Examples of coenzymes :: Most vitamins (some are raw materials for coenzymes), others are coenzymes
What does the vitamin B3 (niacin) perform assist with? :: Synthesis of fats, glycogen, and amino acids
What does the vitamin B7 (biotin) perform assist with? :: Energy production
What does the vitamin B9 (folic acid) perform assist with? :: Nucleic acid and amino acid metabolic reactions
