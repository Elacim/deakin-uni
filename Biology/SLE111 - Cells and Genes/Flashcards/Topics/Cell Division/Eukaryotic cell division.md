Why may a chromatid be considered as a chromosome? :: The chromatid would be a copy
After DNA duplication in a 2n organism with 46 chromosomes, is it still 2n? How many chromosomes and chromatids? :: It is still 2n. It would still be a 2n organism with 46 chromosomes, but now with 92 chromatids
What chromosome number of a cell can undergo meiosis? :: Anything above 1n as a cell can not reduce further (to an integer)

- Sister chromatids are two copies of **one** chromosome

# Mitosis

|               | Pre-I | Post-I | Post-Mit. | Post-Mei I | Post-Mei II |
| ------------- | ----- | ------ | --------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Chromosome \# | 46    | 46     | 46        | 23         | 23          |
| Chromatid #   | 46    | 92     | 46        | 46         | 23          |
Count the chromosomes from the centromere (chromatid count does not influence chromosome count, centromere count does)

[[Meiosis]]
## Plants
https://www.digitalatlasofancientlife.org/learn/embryophytes/life_cycle/

What does the '-phyte' suffix denote? :: It means plant or plant-like
Meaning of the name 'gametophyte' :: Gamete-producing plant
Meaning of the name 'sporophyte' :: Spore-producing plant

Gametophyte :: The haploid gamete, sexually reproducing stage of the plant life cycle
Examples of gametophytes :: Pollen grain, sperm, immature seed (ovule/eggs), 
Sporophyte :: The multicellular diploid stage of the plant life cycle that through **meiosis**, produces haploid spores
Examples of sporophytes :: Those dangly grass/moss bits, 
What exactly is a seed? :: A fertilised ovule that has matured
What does a seed contain? :: A sporophyte embryo and nutrition

Bryophyte sperm shape :: Human-sperm shaped but with two flagella
What is a sporangium? :: A spore-forming container/enclosure/receptacle
What is a sporange? :: An old fashioned word for sporangium (which is a spore-forming container)
What does 'sporangium' mean? :: Spore vessel (spora + angeion)

1. Female/Male gametophyte (1n) produces female/male gametes (1n) through mitosis 
2. Female + Male gametes fuse to form a (2n) zygote
3. The zygote splits through mitosis and forms (2n) sporophytes
4. The sporophytes produce (1n) spores through meiosis
5. The spores split through mitosis and grow into gametophytes

1. A gametophyte produces a sperm and another produces an egg
2. These fuse and form a zygote. This zygote develops into a seed.
3. This seed then develops into a sporophyte, like those dangly moss bits
4. The sporophyte's sporangium produces haploid spores which turn into gametophytes


Autogamy :: The self-pollination of a single flower (stamen-produced pollen pollinating it's ovules)
Geitonogamy :: The self-pollination of a single plant from one flower to another (pollen from one flower pollinates a different flower on the same plant)
Xenogamy :: The pollination of another plant (pollen from one plant's flower fertilises another plant's flower)

# Misc.
Independent assortment :: Random orientation and position of tetrads leads to a 50/50 chance of a maternal set going one way or vice versa, this is not forced and is independent of every other tetrad

1 cell with two chromosomes has two possibilities in metaphase 1
2 cells with four chromosomes has 4 possibilities (2 are duplicates)
```
Metaphase I (1 cell)
	bbrr             bbrr
	bbrr             rrbb
Metaphase II (2 cells)
	bb rr            bb rr
	bb rr            rr bb
Anaphase/Telophase/Cytokinesis II (4 cells)
	bb bb rr rr      br br rb rb
Since there are duplicates, the total combination count is 4
```
With humans, excluding crossover, the possible gamete count is $2^{23}=\text{roughly }8 \text{ million}$
With random fertilisation, the combination count is about 70 trillion 
Crossover, indepedent assortment, and random fertilisation = crazy town
