Why are the offspring of sibling/cousin breeding more likely to have dangerous genetic disorders/conditions? :: With breeding with unrelated individuals, any recessive alleles are unlikely to match up and cause problems. As siblings/cousins are very closely related, the probability of matching up recessive alleles dramatically, therefore causing autosomal recessive conditions (positive or harmful)

What is sickle-cell anaemia? :: Where cells are sickle shaped and have a less effective, sticky version of haemoglobin that clumps and clogs readily
