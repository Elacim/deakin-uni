#### Techniques
- Blurting - write down as much information about a topic as you can (e.g. types of [[-- Structures overview --]] and their purposes). See how much you got correct and see what you missed by going through a textbook/looking it up.
- Look in the textbook and at your notes
- [[#Cornell note taking method]]
- Flash cards - be brief
- Use highlighters and coloured pens
- Make up silly sentences
- Look at past exams / questions to find knowledge gaps

###### Cornell note taking method:
It ensures that all your notes stick to the same structure, as you divide each page into three sections rather than writing across the whole width. You write the key prompts or headings in a column on the left, the main notes section is a wider column next to that, and you use the bottom of the page to write a summary.
