### Photosynthesis
- light energy from the Sun -> powers chemical process for making organic molecules (glucose)
- occurs in [[Chloroplasts]], found in leaf cells

Autotroph - 'self' + 'feeder' = self-feeders
- plants and other organisms that make all their own organic matter from inorganic nutrients
Heterotroph - 'other' + 'feeders' = other-feeders
- humans and other animals that can't make organic molecules from inorganic ones
Organic vs inorganic molecules?

Humans are heavily reliant on plants -> we consume them directly or consume animals that have eaten those plants

Cellular respiration: Harvests energy from organic molecules
	- Occurs in [[Mitochondria]]
	- Waste products ($CO_{2}$ and $H_2O$) are used in photosynthesis

[[Aerobic and Anaerobic]] [[Metabolism]]
Anaerobic - occurs when body's oxygen demand is unable to be met
#### Aerobic respiration
-  occurs when oxygen reaches cells to support energy needs
- primary way of harnessing chemical energy from food and converted to ATP
- Glucose is broken down in a series of steps (Citric Acid/Kreb's cycle)
- Chemical energy is released and used to synthesise ATP, with some energy lost as heat

$NADH$ - nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) + hydrogen (H)
$FADH_{2}$ - flavin adenine dinucleotide
- These are coenzymes and electron carriers. ATP is the primary energy transferring molecule in the cell
- ATP, energy is in phosphate bonds (exergonic reaction)
Glucose is a common fuel - $H$ and it's electron(s?) go from sugar to oxygen, forming water. During cellular respiration, $H$ and it's bonding electrons change partners.

Redox (reduction-oxidation) reactions - chemical reactions that transfer electrons from one substance to another
- oxidation - loss of electrons during a redox reaction
- reduction - gain of electrons during a redox reaction
- OIL RIG  (**O**xidation **I**s **L**oss, **R**eduction **I**s **G**ain)
- The electrons and $H$s that are lost during the glucose oxidation are gained during the reduction of oxygen

##### Glycolysis
- occurs in [[Cytoplasm]]
- Only creates 2 ATP
- Anaerobic
- Splitting sugars
- Breaks a $6C$ glucose into two three-carbon molecules called Pyruvic Acid/Pyruvate
	- These donate high energy electrons to $NAD^{+}$, forming $NADH$
- ATP synthesised are made by substrate level phosphorylation 
- Uses 2 ATP in return for a net total of 4 (profit is 2 ATP)

##### Citric Acid/Kreb's Cycle/TCA
SLIDE 10
Full cycle with all molecules is not assessed (slide 12b)
- Pyruvate taken into the [[Mitochondria]] by active transport
	- converted to a more useful/usable form, Acetyl CoA
- Series of reactions under enzyme control
- Mitochondria's matrix and inner membrane
- Extracts sugar's energy by breaking down acetic acid molecules (vinegar) progressively into CO2
- Electrons transferred to the electron carriers $NADH$ and $FADH_2$
- 1 glucose = 2 acetyl CoA
- 1 acetyl CoA = $2CO_{2}+ 3NADH + 1FADH_{2} + 1ATP$
	- This means that if you get asked for 1 glucose, you will get 2ATP
	
 Input: 1 acetic acid, $ADP + P, 3NAD^+, FAD$
 Output: $2CO_2, ATP, 3NADH^{2-}, FADH_2$
Either FADH or NADH is produced

##### Electron Transport Chain (ETC)
- occurs in [[Mitochondria]]'s inner membranes
	- millions of transport proteins of ETC are built into inner membranes
- creates lots of ATP
- Aerobic
- Happens with *Chemiosmosis* to make up the process of oxidative phosphorylation (the process of phosphorus being added)
- Series of redox reactions as electrons are passed along TC
- Chain acts as a chemical machine uses electron going down states to pump $H^{+}$ across inner mitochondrial membrane
	$H^{+}$ stores potential energy
	pH changes
	primary purpose of ETC
Oxygen accepts electrons at the end of the transport chain
	prevents bad things

Because there is a $H^{+}$ gradient, they re-enter the mitochondrial matrix
	This releases energy, powering ATP synthase
	Known as 'proton motive force'
	Oxygen accepts remaining electrons, turns to $H_2O$
	$NADH$ and $FADH_{2}$ donate electrons to the chain
10 million ATP/s

###### Chemiosmosis
$NADH$ from glycolysis and TCA enters mitochondrion and delivers electrons to protein complex I
1 $NADH$ generates enough proton motive force for 2.5 ATP molecules
$FADH_{2}$ from TCA delivers electrons to protein complex II, enough proton motive force for 1.5 ATP molecules
$NADH$ and $FADH_{2}$ = 4 ATP




# Part B
Oxygen is important to be an electron acceptor - if electrons reach the end of the ETC - they will be taken up by the NAD etc.
	- This leads to NAD etc. all being used
	- This has the side effect of the citric acid cycle stopping

### Anaerobic metabolism
- $O_{2}$ is not essential for all organisms nor required at all times

Alcoholic fermentation - slide
- acetaldehyde acts as an electron acceptor and oxidises the $NADH$ to $NAD^{+}$
- ![[Alcoholic fermentation.png]]
Lactic acid fermentation
- pyruvate acts as an electron acceptor, oxidising $NADH$ to $NAD^{+}$
- ATP produced by substrate level phosphorylation
- muscles can go aerobically for about 15 seconds
- relies on glycolysis to produce ATP
	- Pyruvic acid is reduced by NADH, producing NAD+ etc.

#### Not assessable
---------------
ETC blockers
	- rotenone (insecticide)
		- blocks 1st ETC protein complex
	- cyanid and $CO$
		- blocks 3rd electron transport protein
- Uncouplers
	- DNP Dyes/photography
	- makes inner membrane leaky to $H^{+}$ ions
		- removes gradient, preventing ATP generation
	- ETC continues
------------- 

Cellular respiration can burn diverse carbohydrates, fats, and proteins
- more complex molecules are broken down first (controlled by enzymes)
	- Starch & carbohydrates -> glucose
	- Proteins -> amino acids -> carbon skeletons -> amino groups
	- Fats (lipids) -> fatty acids and glycerol
- Sugars/glycerol enter glycolysis
- Amino acids can enter anywhere in the respiration process
- Fatty acids are converted to CoA -> Kreb's
Stored carbo and fats are used up first, when scarce, muscle proteins may be broken down into amino acids
	- converted to glucose by the liver
	- (glucose is the starting point)

### [[Macromolecules]] synthesis
- cellular respiration products are used to synthesise macromolecules that may be required later
Glycolysis and Kreb's are metabolic interchanges
	- amino acids -> protein and glucose
	- pyruvate -> glucose and glycogen
	- amino acids and pyruvate -> fats
