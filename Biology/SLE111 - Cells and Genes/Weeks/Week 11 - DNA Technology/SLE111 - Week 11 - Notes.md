## Recombinant DNA technology
What is the purpose of recombinant DNA technologies? :: To modify organisms with human-created (recombinant) DNA 
What is an organism with recombinant DNA known as? :: A genetically modified organism
What field is recombinant DNA technology used? :: Biotechnology
When recombinant DNA is being created, is the DNA exclusively from one species? :: Not necessarily. DNA from the same species makes sense, but we can put human DNA into plasmids. Whatever works works.
What is the most common vector for recombinant DNA technology? :: Recombinant plasmids taken up by bacteria
What do recombinant plasmids allow in regards to purity? :: The isolation of genes in a pure form

Genetic engineering :: Direct manipulation of genes for practical purposes
Gene cloning :: Production of multiple copies of a gene that be isolated
What is the purpose of gene cloning? :: The increased genetic material allow more opportunities for doing experiments with
Cloning vector :: DNA molecule that can carry a gene into a cell and replicate it (plasmids and bacteriophages)
Clone of cells:: A group of genetically identical cells, derived from a single cell

Restriction enzymes :: Enzymes that cut DNA at specific base sequences and are derived from bacteria
Restriction fragments :: DNA pieces produced by digesting DNA wtih a restriction enzyme
Vector :: Used to carry DNA pieces (like plasmids, phages, etc.)
Recombinant vector :: A modified vector containing DNA
Host cell :: Used to accept and replicate the recombinant vector (bacteria/animal/plant cells can all be used)

Genomic library :: A set of thousands of DNA segments from a genome that are each carried by a vector
cDNA :: A DNA copy of mRNA prepared using reverse transcriptase (as the mRNA has all introns removed, the cDNA will only have the exons)
cDNA library :: A set of thousands of cDNA fragments clned into a vector and represents the sequences of mRNAs found in a particular cell or tissue
What is the purpose of cDNA? :: It can provide an easier view into the coding regions of genes without going through the non-coding regions

Plasmids :: A small, circular (loops back on itself), extrachromosomal piece of DNA separate from the larger bacterial chromosome
What does it mean when a plasmid is circular? :: It does not strictly mean it is a circle, it only means it loops back on itself, meaning it can be any wonky shape.
- easily incorporate foreign DNA, readily taken up by bacterial cells
- act as vectors
	- DNA carriers moving genes from one cell to another
	- Plasmids that are successful in incorporating foreign DNA -> recombinant plasmids

A cloning vector must have :: An origin of replication; a dominant selectable marker; and at least one unique restriction site/sequence
![[Plasmid vector 3 requirements.png]]


Endonucleases :: Makes cuts within a DNA strand (restriction enzymes are known as restriction endonucleases)
Exonucleases cut from the end of the DNA strand

Restriction enzymes :: Cut DNA at specific nucleotide sequences
	- Restriction fragments with stucky ends that are important for joining DNA from different sources (overhang is possible, like joining pieces of paper)
	- Cut DNA at defined nucleotide sequences called recognition sequences or cut site
		- Palindromes 
		- Around 4-8 base pairs long (balances lots vs little frequency)
Recombinant DNA -> made from bacterial plasmid + gene of interest
	- sticky ends will be produced on the plasmid and foreign DNA inserted if cut by the same restriction enzyme
		- need to anneal together due to complementary base pairing
	- DNA ligase re-joins fragments together to produce recombinant DNA molecules

### Blue-white screening
A rapid screening technique used for identification of recombinant plasmids

In the presence of lactose, $\beta$ -galactosidase -> cleaves lactose into glucose and galactose
	- coded for in the lac-operon
Multiple Cloning Site (MCS) is present in the coding region of the lac Z operon
	- foreign DNA can be inserted to using restriction enzymes
Instead of lactose, chromogenic substrate X-Gal is used
	When hydrolysed by galactosidase, it gives a blue precipitate
All recombinant plasmids will have the gene of interest (foreign DNA) inserted into the MCS
	- All recombinants will give a white colony as they are unable to produce galactosidase as the coding region of it is disrupted by the foreign DNA insertion
	- Therefore, all non-recombinant plasmids will give a blue colony as they can produce a functional galactosidase

# Gel electrophoresis - slide 13a-14b
![[gel-electric-field-agarose-buffer-solution-DNA.gif]]

Kilobases (kBP) :: 1,000 base pairs
Relationship between DNA fragment size and distance is negatively curvlinear (inversely proportional)
Dissolving the gel on the DNA you want is a way to check stuff - use dominant markers etc. to find exactly the gene you want

# PCR - Polymerase chain reaction
What is the purpose of PCR? :: To copy any DNA segment quickly and precisely
Three steps of PCR :: Heating (denaturation); cooling (annealing); and replication (extension)
PCR is exponential

True or false: DNA polymerase is needed: true, it recruits
Taq DNA polymerase from Thermus Aquaticus (works well in the high temperatures PCR undergoes) 
PCR works in a thermocycler (tiny oven)

Times/temps are a range due to differences in each DNA molecule and something else
Heating: 93-95°C (1-5 mins)
Annealing: 50-60°C (30-45s)
Elongation: 70-75°C (1-2 mins)

Through this, you'll get long template strands and the target DNA duplicated
- through gel electrophoresis, you can get the correct base pair length
COVID - if negative test -> the amplified PCR test doesn't connect with any COVID proteins

# Part B
iversity 00113B • Understand the general concepts of DNA sequencing • Understand the following processes • Chain termination sequencing • Next-generation sequencing • Nanopore sequencing • CRISPR-Cas 9 • Cloning • Gene therapy
e aware of some application for PCR and sequencing • Understand the process of DNA fingerprinting, and how to interpret those results • Be aware of the use of transgenic organisms, and the impact they can have • Be aware of genomics and proteomics


### DNA sequencing
[[Sanger's Method]]

**Next generation sequencing - Slide 7b-8b**
1. We use 400-1000 base pairs instead of a whole gene etc.
2. Each fragment is isolated with a bead in a droplet of aqueous solution
3. This fragment is PCR'd (copying it) All 5' ends
Bootstrapping : Stick everything together - overlapping fragments
	- finished strand
- 70-90 million nucleotides/hour

**Nanopore sequencing - Slide 9a**
Sequences long single DNA strands of DNA w/o fragments or amplification
- Single strand passes through nanopores, guided through this aperture bt an enzyme
- Each nucleotide disrupts the electric current in a unique way
- Nanopore sequencers

**Progress of technology**
Early 2000s  -> 10s to 100s of genetic variants
Current day -> 100,000s to millions of genetic variations
Human Genome Project - \$1 Billion US dollars
As of now, it takes only a few thousand dollars/genome

**CRISPR/Cas 9**
- bacterial immune system to survive bacteriophage attacks
- mismatch - cause cut elsewhere?
- Germ-line editing is unlikely due to ethical considerations


### Applications of PCR and sequencing
Phylogenetics - the understanding of patterns in ancestry, taxonomy, and ecological associations
Population genetics - relatedness, spatial scales of gene flow, population structure, factors influencing population fitness and adaptability, and local adaptation
Genome wide association studies (GWAS) - Identification of genetic variants across the genome showing associations with traits of interest
	- medicine
	- selective breeding
	- environmental adaptations
	- understanding genetic basis of natural selection and trait variation

DNA fingerprinting/profilin
- Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys
- differences in genetic material between individuals is in single bases and repeated DNA sequences (mainly non-coding regions)
- differences can be detected by using PCR, restriction digestion, and gel electrophoresis
- Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLP) - in some people, this restriction site is present while in others, it's absent

- There are many Tandem Repeat Sequences in the human genome
	- in non-coding regions
	- known as being hypervariable (lots of variation between individuals)
	- 2-5 base pairs long (short tandem repeats)
	- These allow DNA fingerprinting
	- e.g. Individual one may have (AGAT: 7 repeats, .... AGAT: 19 repeats) while individual two may have (AGAT: 2 repeats, .... AGAT: 9 repeats)
Paternity cases -

Genetic profiling can be used for conservation - Minke whales are illegally caught by Japanese Whalers
Exoneration

STR :: Short tandem repeats
Two STR values - `12,19` - `maternal,paternal`
STRmix - 21 STR values

Josef Mengele was found in Brazil


### Cloning
Using less differentiated cells (like stem cells) instead of highly differentiated cells (like muscle cells, blood cells etc.) allows a higher chance of cloning being successful
Enucleation :: The removal of a cell nucleus

#### Stem cells
- can reproduce itself indefinitely
- can differentiate into specialised cells of one or more types
Pluripotent can differentiate into some type of cell
Embryonic stem cells can differentiate into any type of cell
	- Isolated from early embryos at the blastocyst stage
By taking certain markers from differentiated cells, they can be deprogrammed into stem cells
Possible uses of stem cells :: Understanding genetic progresses, study progression of a disease, cellular therapy production, discover and screen new drugs

Dolly the sheep - first cloned mammal - using the nucleus of a differentiated mammary gland cell
	- One out of several hundred of tried embryos
		- Others died from obesity, lung/liver disease, or early death
	- nuclei from mature cells need to undergo demethylation
		- removing epigenetic tags
		- presence of diseases in cloned animals shows an incomplete reprogramming
Why aren't humans cloned? :: Aside from ethics, the germ line effects would linger dramatically throughout future generations

### Human gene therapy
- recombinant DNA procedure that seeks to treat disease by altering the genes of the afflicted person
	- Mutant gene is replaced or supplemented with a properly functioning one
	- Done via vectors like bone marrow (or other cells that are produced fast and lifelong)
 - widely agreed to only be done on somatic cells, not germ-line cells

##### Challenges
- targeting the defective cell
- the immune system fighting back 
- major side effects
	- insert into the wrong place and disrupt another gene
	- gene product may adversely affect other cellular properties
	- may not have the intended effect

##### Methods
DNA microinjection :: Desired gene is injected into sperm/egg nucleus, after growth, then transferred to a recipient female
Retrovirus-mediated gene transfer :: Retroviruses are used as vectors to transfer genetic material into the host cell
Stem cell transgenesis :: Direct modification of the genome in vitro before introduction into animals/plants

LAMB3 gene example - skin blistering mutation (Junctional epidermolysis bullosa)
- epidermal cells from non-blistered regions are isolated
- In the lab, these are infected with a retrovirus carrying a non-mutated LAMB3 gene
- In vitro growth -> holoclones (proliferative and contain stem cells); paraclones/meroclones (intermediate state of proliferation)
- Cell growth produces sheets of tissues - which were transplanted back to the patient
- Skin was able to fully regenerate, and after 8 months was purely derived from holoclones

### Genomics
- the science of studying whole genomes and how genes interact
- Worms/yeast/plants (150 species) sequenced
- Evolutionary relationships can be determined
- Expression patterns can be measured by gene arrays
- Compare normal genes to abnormal
- Discover new genes
### Proteomics
- looks at sets of proteins
- more difficult than genomics (as it includes all modifications after translation)

### Transgenic organisms
Transgenesis :: The process of manually adding new DNA to an organism
Transgenic organism :: An organism containing genetic material from another organism
Examples :: Cows producing more milk, super salmon, leaner pigs, golden rice (more nutritious rice)
- they can be used as pharmaceutical factories as they (can) produce large amounts of (sometimes rare) substances
Bacterial genes are often introduced to human cells and vice versa
Human genes are inserted into other organisms to... :: Study the effects of mutations, to correct the effects of mutations
Why are human genes often inserted into other species? :: To see what happens

Bacterial examples:
- Human Insulin - E. Coli
- Human growth hormone (for growth disorders) - E. coli
- Tumour necrosis factor - E. Coli
- Taxol (for cancer treatment) - E. Coli
- Factor VIII (for haemophilliacs) - mammalian cells
- Erythropoietin (for anaemia and sport drug enhancers) - mammalian cells

Bacteria can be used to degrade oils
Plants and fungi can accumulate heavy metal

**Ethical questions**
- benefits against hazards of creating harmful products/procedures
- guidelines are in place in countries that ensure safe practices for recombinant DNA technologoy
- most public concern is about food (GMO foods)
- concern about the creation of super weeds - from the transfer of genes from GM crops to their wild relatives
