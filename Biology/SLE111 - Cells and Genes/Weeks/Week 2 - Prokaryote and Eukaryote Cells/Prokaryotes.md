Prokaryotes
	- Significantly smaller (less internal structures being a big reason)
	- Generally simpler
	- No DNA in membrane (nucleus), it's free flowing - no organelles (loosely connected to the plasma membrane)
	- Single celled
	- Either as free living or colonies
	- Some are anchored, others mobile
	- Protective cell wall
	- Many structures similar to eukaryotes, but lack true organelles
		- Still have cytoplasmic ribosomes
	- Two types - bacteria and archaea (previously known as monera)

Cell wall - 
Plasma membrane - lipid barrier below cell wall
Cytoplasm - jelly like component of the cell & site of energy metabolism
Nucleoid region - DNA location

| Ribosomes       | Site of protein synthesis                       |
| Flagella        | Movement (swimming). Spins in a circle.         |
| Capsule         | Adhesion to surfaces and pathogenicity          |
| Pili/Fimbriae   | Attachment to surface and antibiotic resistance |
|                 |                                                 |

Prokaryote DNA:
 - ~1/1000th the DNA than Eukaryotes
 - **One** DNA coiled in nucleoid region
 - Attached to plasma membrane 
 - Some contain rings of extrachrosomal DNA called plasmids
	 - Plasmids often contain antibiotic resistance genes
	 - Important in Biotechnology
	 - These are 'added bonuses' (i.e. non-essential) to the prokaryote 


Identified by gene sequencing and their membrane composition

Archaea are often called extremophiles - halophiles (high salt env), thermophiles (high temp)

A tps of soil can contain ~10k types of prokaryotes

Bacteria can live in soil, rocks, oceans, ice & snow, plants, and animals (e.g. gut bacteria)


#### Identifying prokaryotes 
- Observe size and shape
	Shape:
		- spherical (cocci)
		- rod-shaped (bacilli)
		- spiral
- Differential staining (e.g. Gram stain)
- Ability to grow w/ or w/o oxygen
- Nutrient reqs.
- Antibody studies

#### Gram staining
Bacterial cell wall is mainly *Peptidoglycan* (absent from Archaea)
Gram positive - large amounts of peptidoglycan (staining purple)
	- top layer is peptidoglycan
Gram negative - more complex cell wall (staining red)
	- top layer is an outer membrane
	- middle is peptidoglycan

#### Disease causing
Gram-positive bacteria - highly stable structures
	- Highly stable
	- Can be dormant
	- Germinates when conditions are favourable
	- Is associated with several diseases
	- Is resistant to heat/cold/lack of nutrients
	- Not destroyed by antiseptic chems or disinfection (i.e. boiling)
		- 2 hours to boil dead

Pathogenic bacteria:
	- Causes diseases when present in host

Opportunistic pathogens:
	- ability to cause disease in compromised host (normally no effect)
	- e.g. Lyme disease)

Some disrupt physiology by growth & invasion
Most cause illness through toxins
	- Exotoxins
		- Usually secreted
		- e.g. food poisoning cholera, diptheria
	- Endotoxins
		- Outer membrane components of gram-negative bacteria 
		- Usually causes fever/aches
		- e.g. Typhoid fever

#### Antibiotics
Defensive chems produced from fungi and bacteria
	e.g. penicillin
Broad spectrum - kills either type of bacteria (gram pos/neg)



#### Nutritional reqs.


Autotroph:
	Photoautotroph ()



#### Symbiotic prokaryotes 
Normal flora:
	- microbial flora (bacteria as a whole - positive and negative bacteria)
	- projects host by effectively competing with potential pathogens 
	- produce vitamins
	- assist in breakdown of food
	- in just about all parts of the body 
		- less so in lungs and stomach (except hardy yeasts/bacteria)
			- these hardy yeasts/bacteria can break down food into more nutritious food
- Major role in recycling chemical elements in ecosystems
- Use in research and tech
	- Dairy industry
	- Vitamin production
	- Sewage treatment
	- Cleaning oil spills
	- Biotechnology


Nitrogen-fixing bacteria
	- live in root nodules of plants 
	- converts atmostpheric nitrogen to ammonia which can be used by plants 
	- bacteria utilise sugars made by plants
