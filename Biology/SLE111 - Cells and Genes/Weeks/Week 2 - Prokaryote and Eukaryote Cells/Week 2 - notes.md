[[Polar molecules]] connect well with polar molecules
	-> Water (polar) dissolves table salt

Cells can vary drastically in size and function
Mostly 1 micrometer-100 micrometer
	This is because of Surface Area:Volume ratio
		We function more effectively with many cells as it has a higher surface area
			- bigger volume = tougher to transport nutrients, get rid of waste etc.

Microscopes:
	- Light microscope (larger structures)
	- Scanning Electron Microscope - mainly for surface of cells (s for scanning, s for surface) 
	- Transmission Electron Microscope - mainly for detailed internal structures


Eukaryotes presumed to have evolved when the plasma membrane folded in on itself forming the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear membrane
	- Engulfed other smaller prokaryote organism capable of producing own energy (mitochondria have different DNA to ours)

Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes contain:
	- Nucleic acids (hereditary material)
	- [[Organelles#Ribosomes|Ribosomes]] (translate genetic info to proteins)
	- Cell/plasma membrane (isolate cell from ext. environment)
