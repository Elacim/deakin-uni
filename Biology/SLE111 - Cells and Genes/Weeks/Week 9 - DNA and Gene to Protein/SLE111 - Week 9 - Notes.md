Enzyme explanations - slide 14a
What does polymerase do? :: 
[[Proteins and Enzymes in genetics]]

Leading strand - DNA polymerases can only add nucleotides to the 3' end of a strand
	- DNA polymerase III can synthesise a complementary strand continuously
	- moves towards replication fork
Elongating the lagging strand - DNA polymerase III works in the direction away from the replication fork
	- fragments called Okazaki fragments
		- joined by DNA ligase

[[Lagging strand synthesis]]

Polymerase I - removes primers & replaces w/ DNA nucleotides
Polymerase III - recruits new nucleotides to the growing strand
[[Ligase]]

What end of a DNA strand does DNA polymerase III add to? :: The 3' prime end

Short RNA segments :: Produced by primase, these act as primers and recruit DNA polymerase III

##### DNA error-correction
DNA polymerase proofreads newly made DNA by replacing any incorrect nucleotides
Purpose of Nuclease :: It excises damaged stretches of DNA
Purpose of DNA polymerase and DNA ligase in error correction :: The replacing and sealing of nucleotides


# Protein synthesis
Transcription :: The synthesis of RNA under the direction of DNA (makes mRNA)
Translation :: The synthesis of a polypeptide from mRNA instructions
Where does translation occur? :: In ribosomes

In prokaryotes/cells lacking a nucleus, transcription and translation occur simultaneously
In Eukaryotes, the RNA is modified to become mRNA and then can move out of the nucleus

What does mRNA stand for? :: Messenger RNA
	What does mRNA do? :: It carries the gnetic information form the DNA to to ribosome
What does tRNA stand for? :: Transfer RNA
What does tRNA do? :: It carries the amino acids to the ribosome and recognises the codon on mRNA
Codon :: Triplets of nucleotide bases that encode proteins
What is a codon table? :: A table the shows all the possible 64 codons that can be encoded with our AUGC nucleotides
How do you use a codon table? :: Find the first base on the left side, the second on the top, then the third base using the right.

What does the AUG codon encode for? :: Methyeline, or START
What codons encode for STOP? :: UAA, UAG, and UGA
What codon encodes for START? :: AUG
What does the UAA codon encode for? :: STOP
What does the UAG codon encode for? :: STOP
What does the UGA codon encode for? :: STOP



From genotype to phenotype
- RNA polymerase makes the mRNA molecule using template DNA
- mRNA is complentary (though with Uracil)
- mRNA is synthesised in the 5' to 3' direction, same as DNA
- RNA polymerase does not need a primer (unlike DNA)
- In prokaryotes, single RNA polymerase makes all types of RNA
- In eukaryotes, RNA polymerase II produces mRNA
	- Eukaryotes have specific RNA polymerases for differing RNA types


# Transcription and Translation
What does 'transcript' mean? :: A word-to-word copy of something
What is transcription? :: The process of making an RNA copy of a DNA sequence

RNA polymerase moves along the DNA and untwists the double helix
How many bases does RNA polymerase expose at a time? :: Roughly 10-20
What is the advantage of RNA polymerase exposing few bases? :: The DNA can easily reform hydrogen bonds as the polymerase moves on

The DNA strand reforms the double helix

###### Termination - Slide 4a

UTRs :: Untranslated regions - buffer to prevent damage 
What is the terminator region? :: A section of nucleotides that RNA polymerase recognises as the 'stop transcripting'
Does the RNA polymerase stop at codon regions encoding for STOP? :: No.

## Processing of eukaryote mRNA
RNA is processed after transcription
Introns :: Non-coding regions - hypervariable regions
How 
Exons :: Coding regions
Definition of splicing :: The joining of two regions of an object, like two ends of a rope or two ends of RNA
What is a 5' cap? :: 
What is the purpose of a 5' cap? :: 
What is a poly-A tail? :: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA string of adenine
When are poly-A tails added? :: At the end of translation
What is the function of poly-A tails? :: Nucleotide transport, enhances RNA stability, and prevents degradation

What happens in RNA processing?
?
1. Adding a 5' cap and a poly A tail
2. Removing introns
3. Splicing exons together


## Translation
With what type of RNA is protein translated? :: tRNA (transfer RNA)


SLIDE 5a


What cell structure makes polypeptides? :: Ribosomes
What are the components of ribosomes? :: The small and large subunits
What RNA do ribosomes contain? :: Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
DIAGRAM ON SLIDE 5b
What type(s) of RNA does a ribosome hold? :: tRNA and mRNA

###### Initiation
What happens in initiation? :: The mRNA, first amino acid with it's complementary tRNA, and the two subunits of the ribosome are brought together
mRNA has a cap and tail - help to bind to ribosomes
5' of mRNA binds to small subunit
Initiator tRNA (codon UAC) will bind to AUG
tRNA carries the starting amino acid methionine
The large subunit completes the initiation
Translation initiation complex :: The combined mRNA, starting amino acid methionine, and the ribisme??? **EXPAND**

###### Elongation
1. Codon recognition: Anticodon of incoming tRNA pairs with the mRNA codon
2. Peptide bond formation: Ribosome catalyses bond formation between amino acids
3. Translocation: A tRNA leaves the P site of the ribosome
	1. Ribosome moves down the mRNA


![[Ribosome - protein synthesis.png]]
###### Termination
1. When a stop codon is reached, the A site of the ribosome receives a 'release factor'. This release factor is shaped similarly to tRNA instead of an aminoacyl RNA
2. The release factor promotes hydrolysis of the bond between the tRNA in the P site and the last amino acid of the polypeptide, thus freeing the polypeptide from the ribosome.
3. The two ribosomal subunits and the other components of the assembly dissociate with the hydrolysis of two GTP molecules.

DNA strand -> Transcription -> RNA -> Translation -> Polypeptide

Ribosomes can use the same mRNA molecule in a chain, known as polyribosomes. 
	- when a 5' cap (guanine nucleotide) is off, the next one starts
	- less resource usage by reusing
	- more efficient than 1 polypeptide at a time
