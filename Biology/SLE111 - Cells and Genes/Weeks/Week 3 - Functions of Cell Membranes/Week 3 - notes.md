Cytoskeleton diagram
![[Cytoskeleton-diagram.png]]

Microtubules
	- 25nm (15nm lumen)
	- Hollow tubes made of tubulin
	- Important for
		- Cell shape
		- [[Organelles|Organelle]] movement
		- Mitotic spindle formation
	- e.g. Cilia and flagella
Intermediate filaments
	- 8-12nm
	- Rope like structure
	- Reinforcing rods
		- e.g. nails, hair, inner lining of nuclear envelope
Microfilaments
	- 7nm
	- Protein called Actin 
	- Helps cells change shape & move (e.g. muscle)

Actin and tubulin cytoskeletons allow for cellular movement and organelle movement

9-2 arrangement is how tubules are arranged (9 outer tubules, 2 inner)
9-0 - 9 outer tubules, 0 inner
![[Cilia tubule arrangements.png|400]]

Centrosome - separates chromosomes
Centrioles - 9-0 arrangement
Basal-body- the start of a flagella/cilia
Flagella - usually significantly longer than cilia 

Histones condense down DNA

#### Joining cells
Intercellular junctions help integrate cells into more a structured and functional unit
	- Neighbours interact through direct physical contact
	- Tight junctions and desmosomes are bonds that hold cells together
		- Tight junctions -> Superglue. Impermeable.
			- e.g. Bladder cells, Caludins and occludins
		- Desmosomes -> bind cells to each other. Maintains cell formation e.g. heart, skin, stretchy tissues
			- Cadherins
 - Both plants and animal cells have intercellular junctions
- Plasmodesmata in plants
- Gap junctions in animals
	- channel for transport (through pores).
		- nutrients and signalling molecules
		-e.g. Heart muscles cells
	 - Connexons
Plant cells have a cell membrane and cell wall
	- Cell wall is made of cellulose fibers embedded in a polysaccharide and protein matrix
	- Plasmodesmata connects adjacent cells
		- Maintains cell shape
		- 'pla' - plant cell. Plasmodesmata is only in plant cells.


#### Plasma membrane
- All cells have a plasma membrane. Plants and bacteria (peptidoglycan) have a cell wall.
- Has proteins, carbohydrates built into it.
- Controls molecular traffic in/out of cell
- Net negative charge inside the cell

Most membrane lipids/some proteins can drift laterally with the membrane. They can rotate and flex too
Physical constraints stop molecules 'flipping' from side to side (hydrophobic things want to stay out the water). It can happen in extreme cases.

Cholesterol maintains membrane stability.
Coldness huddles the lipids - at low enough temps, it's called crystallised. Fluidity decreases with temp.
High temps distances the lipids.
Cholesterol can 'insert' itself into the cell membrane, holding the membrane together. At low temps, it increases fluidity and at high in lowers fluidity. Think of cholesterol as a buffer.
Lipids don't have to be 1:1 opposite

#### Saturated vs. unsaturated
Saturated
	Straight
	Stack well, like legos
	Membrane fluidity goes down
Unsaturated
	Kinked
	Membrane fluidity goes up as lipids are further apart

As lipids move, proteins etc. keep their fixed place

Extracellular side - carbohydrates and proteins form connections with the extracellular matrix, providing support for the cell
	- Glycoproteins (protein + carbohydrates)
	- Glycolipids (lipid + carbohydrates)
Cytoplasmic side - some proteins contact cytoskeleton parts, forming a structural link
![[Outer and inner cell membrane diagram.png]]

#### Membrane proteins
- transport
- enzymatic activity
- signal transduction
	- converting signal from one to another - a signal producing a cascade of signals inside the cell
- cell-cell recognition
- intercellular joining ([[#Joining cells]])
- Attachment to cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix (ECM)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_energy#Examples
During photosynthesis, specific chlorophyll molecules absorb red-light photons at a wavelength of 700 nm in the photosystem I, corresponding to an energy of each photon of ≈ 2 eV ≈ 3 × 10−19 J ≈ 75 kBT, where kBT denotes the thermal energy. **A minimum of 48 photons is needed for the synthesis of a single glucose molecule from CO2 and water** (chemical potential difference 5 × 10−18 J) with a maximal energy conversion efficiency of 35%.

# Origins of life
- Life maybe started 4 billion years ago (bya) - Earth's crust was cooling
- [[Prokaryotes]] (bacteria and archaea) were the first cells
- How did they come about?
	- chemical evolution on Earth?
	- Outer space?
	- Deep sea?
- Biogenesis - Louis Pasteur (1862) - spontaneous generation (rare) but comes from life itself
- [[Prokaryotes]] were dominant for 2bya
	- Stromatolites give evidence in ancient sedimentary rocks (3.5bya)
- Non-living materials becoming ordered into compounds into aggregates capable of self-replication and [[Metabolism]]
- Life doesn't appear spontaneously anymore (to our knowledge)
- Abiotic synthesis experiments in 1953 (Miller, Urey experiemnt) - organic molecules. Devoid of oxygen but with water/hydrogen/methane -> organic compounds (simple amino acids)

- Lava, rock, or clay may have helped organic monomers form larger molecules
- Heat may have evaporated water and allowed higher concentrations of monomers on Earth's surface
- Early atmosphere - mainly Nitrogen and CO2
- Deep sea vents? - rich in sulfur and iron. Ancient bacteria in hot waters using sulphur
- Protobionts? Abiotically produced molecules potentially being precursors to living cells (maintaining internal environment different to external)

#### Major extinctions
- Ordovician-Silurian mass extinctions
- Late Devonian 
- Permian
- Triassic-Jurassic
- Cretaceous Tertiary (K/T extinction)
New one being the Anthropocene...
