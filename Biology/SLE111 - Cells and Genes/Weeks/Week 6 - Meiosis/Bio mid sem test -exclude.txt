no clue
. 4 (none of the options except a make any kind of sense)
	b: why would they be stored?
	c: why would they remain bound?
	d: why would a protein turn into a carbohydrate? -- can technically be true (protein -> amino acids -> glucose) but the question asks for AFTER mitosis, not during
. 22 (notes has 3 as the answer)

unsure questions
. 13 - CO_2 is 'removed'? I think that means breathed out. a/c are definitely wrong. 'Removal of CoA' happens in Krebs.
. 24 (fairly confidently 9 NADH, 1 pyruvate=1 acetyl=3 NADH)
. 40 - a or b - not b, they are called peripheral proteins but they don't span the entire membrane (and a is definitely true)

odd questioning
. 26 ('electrons only' is the most correct)
. 35 (only spindle fibres are broken down)

question is technically wrong
. 27 (correct)
. 39 (lactic acid is more correct than pyruvate)


Still iffy
. 37 (centromeres bind a pair, when they're separated, they aren't a pair, so a is incorrect and therefore the correct answer)

Probably correct but with doubt
. 43 (plasmids/cell wall are both correct, but plasmids can combat antibiotics specifically)
