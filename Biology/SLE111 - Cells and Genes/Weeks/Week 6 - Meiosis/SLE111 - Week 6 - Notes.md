# Part A
## Genetics
Scientific study of heredity and variation
	Heredity: transmission of traits, generation-generation
	Variation: differences in appearance that offspring show (parents, siblings)
Genes
	- segments of DNA
	- two or more alt forms: alleles
	- DNA is packaged into chromosomes
	- passed from gen-gen through gametes (sperm and eggs)
		- one set from each parent
- Chromosomes (in nucleus, contain DNA encoding a protein)
- DNA - functional units (genes)
	- influences a trait
Each pair of homologous chromosomes include one chromosome from each parent
	- Humans are diploid (2 times 23 = 46 total)
	-

Asexual reproduction
	- one parent produces genetically identical daughter cells (mitosis)
	- Clone = genetically individual from the same parent
		- common in single celled organisms
		- some multi-cellular can to, especially plants


Unfertilized egg (ovum) - sex chromo = X
Sperm cell, sex chromo = X or Y

Gametes made in reproductive tissues
	- ovary and testes (meiosis)
	- meiosis
	- fertilisation of gametes -> diploid organism w/ two chromosomal sets
	- Only haploid cells in the body
	- Fuse to form a diploid zygote that divides by mitosis -> bby


### Non-vascular plants - slide 8
- Non-vascular plants are gametophyte-dominant
- Vascular plants are sporophyte-dominant
- alternation of generations
- diploid and haploid multicellular stages
- diploid state (sporophyte)
	- haploid spores via mitosis
		- grows into a haploid stage called gametophyte
			- makes gametes by mitosis
				- fertilisation results in diploid sporophyte
Gametophyte - sexual reproduction (produces gametes (eggs/sperm) - haploid)
When sperm and egg fuse, they give rise to the asexual, diploid Sporophytes
 - stays attached to parent gametophyte
-  - they have a sporangium that produces haploid reproductive cells called spores
Spores disperse and germinate - gametophytes


### Vascular plants
- male gametophyte = pollen
- female gametophyte = ovule
- Fertilized cell grows into a seed
###### Gymnosperms (naked seed)
- Cones
	- Female: Looks like a pinecone. Ovules develop on cone scale surfaces
	- Male: Looks like a small, spongy pinecone (rods growing outwards). Pollen producer.
- adult plant can grow immediately from a seed
	- instead of a spore going through an intermediate gametophyte stage
- Water is (usually) not necessary for reproduction
- lodgepull pine has serotinous cones, only dropping their seeds when exposed to extreme heats (bushfires)
	- competition (other trees, underbrush) is taken out so the seeds have a higher chance of survival

###### Angiosperms (container seed)
- instead of using the wind, they use animals (bees, mosquitoes etc.) to take pollen from male plants and fertilise female plants
	- mutualism
- flowers contain gametophytes (pollen/ovum)
- Sporophyte is the whole plant except the pollen and the ovum
- flowers can be female or male and fertilised even if the flowers are on the same plant

### Parental investment
- females need to be careful about which partner they choose
	- pregnancy is resource intensive
	- finite amount of gametes (eggs)
		- much more costly to produce than males
	- often invest more in parental care
	- cost of of mating with males with poor genetics are higher in females than males
- Males tend to be less selective (human males -> 100-300 million sperm/day)
- Pretty colours are hard to make (bird of paradise, blue-footed booby)
	- show good level of genetic fitness 
- Similar appearance
	- no wooing


# Meiosis
- modified type of cell division (only in sexually reproduction)
	- unlike mitosis, daughter cells have genetically distinct makeup
	- similar to mitosis, meiosis is preceded by chromosome replication
- two rounds of cell division
- one round of DNA replication
- Result is cells with half the number of chromosomal sets as the original
	- 4 daughter cells

### Meiosis I
- preceded by interphase (where chromosomes are replicated - sister chromatids)
	- genetically identical, joined at centromere
###### Prophase I
- 90% of time required for meiosis
- chromosomes being to condense (and therefore become visible under microscope)
- Synapsis: homologous chromosomes loosely pair up; aligned gene-by-gene
- Crossing over: Non-sister chromatids exchange DNA segments (recombination)
- Tetrad: Four chromatids (chromosome pair)

###### Metaphase I
- tetrads line up at metaphase plate
- Unlike mitosis where chromatids split, in meiosis, the whole chromosomes face each pole
- microtubules from each pole are attached to the kinetochore of one chromosome of each tetrad

###### Anaphase I
- pairs of homologous chromosomes separate
- one chromosome to each pole (spindle guided)
- sister chromatids remain attached at the centromere
	- move as one unit to the pole

###### Telophase I and Cytokinesis
- each half has a haploid set of chromosomes
	- each chromo still has two sister chromatids
- cytokinesis
	- cleavage furrow
	- cell plate

![[Meiosis I diagram.png]]

### Meiosis II
- chromosomes are not replicated again (diploid-diploid is pointless), we want to be reductive
- very similar to **mitosis**
	- key difference is the amount of genetic material
- In metaphase II, two sister chromatids of each chromosome are no longer genetically identical (due to crossing over in meiosis I)

![[Meiosis II diagram.png]]

After both rounds, the cells should now be distinct from each other and the parents. These will turn into gametes (eggs or sperm)

| Chromosome count   | Conserves # of chromosome set             | Reduces the # of set (from diploid to haploid) |
| Genetic difference | Cloning - genetically identical to parent | Genetically different from each other & parent |

3 events are unique to meiosis:
- synapsis and crossing over (prophase I)
	- homologous chromosomes physically connect and exchange genetic info
- at metaphase plate, there are paired homologous chromosomes (tetrads) instead of individual replicated chromosomes
- at Anaphase I, homologous chromosomes separate instead of sister chromatids


### Genetic variation
- Comes from:
	- independent assortment of chromosomes
		- pairs independently of each other
		- a few 50/50s of whether it's left or right of the spindle
	- crossing over/recombination
	- random fertilisation
- Humans have ~8.4 million ($2^{23}$) possible chromosome combinations ($2^{n}$)
	- Zygote with any of ~70 trillion diploid combinations
- Crossing over (slide 15b)
	- just need to know it happens, science behind is not examinable

Human cell w/ 22 autosomes and a Y chromosome - haploid -> sperm

How many combinations of maternal and paternal chromosomes can be packaged into **gametes** made by an organism with a diploid number of 4 (2n=4). We split 2n=4 by 2 to get the haploid number, then plug it into the $2^{n}$ equation. So $2^{2}=4$.


##### Non-disjunction
- members of a chromosome pair fail to separate during anaphase
	- such as chromosomes not being attached to spindle, affecting daughter cells
- gametes with an incorrect chromosome count are produced
	- $n+1; n-1$, whole extra sets of chromosomes
- In meiosis I:  (two with +1, two with -1)
- In meiosis II: two with n, one with +1, and one with -1
	- e.g. trisomy 21 (down syndrome)
	- can be mosaic or translocational (less common)
		- stick itself somewhere else (like on top of chromosome 14) instead of directly next to 21
Patau syndrome
	- trisomy 13
	- can be mosaic/translocational 
	- causes severe intellectual disability and physical deformities
	- high mortality rate
Klinefelter syndrome (male) - XXY
XYY (normal male), XXX (normal female)
Turner syndrome (X0)
