#### 1.3. Available equipment

### List of available equipment. 

In order to plan your experiment appropriately you need to know what equipment is available to you. Here is a list of equipment that will be available to you on the day:

- Celery, Onion, Mushroom, Carrot
- Knives 
- Blenders
- Kitchen scales
- universal buffers (pH 4, 6, 7, 8, 10)
- Detergent
- Timers 
- 100 mL & some 200 mL measuring cylinders 
- Autopipettes 1000uL (and tips) 
- Hydrogen Peroxide max. concentration 30 %  (pre prepared concentration of 5%, 10% 20% 30% will be available).  
    H2O2 is diluted with water so it is possible to make other dilutions on the day
- Water baths 3 - 4 (water baths can be set at temperatures from warmer than room temperature up to about 80°C).   
    Temperature can be adjusted on water bath but can take 15 -20 minutes to reach new temperatures.  
    If other groups wish to test different temperatures to your groups you will need to work together to make that happen. 
- Ice buckets  (ice will keep at reaction at ≅ 0 °C)
- Room temperature in the labs is usually 19 -25 °C
