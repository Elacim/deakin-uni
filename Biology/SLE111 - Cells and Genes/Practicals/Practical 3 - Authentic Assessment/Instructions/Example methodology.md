Primary Procedure
1. Using a razor blade, carefully cut the celery into fine pieces (WARNING:
Sharps; risk of cuts; use great care. RISK: Low).
2. Using the balance, weigh out 5 grams of the finely cut celery.
3. Pipette 20 mL of Universal buffer (pH7) into a 100 mL measuring cylinder.
4. To the cylinder add 3 drops of detergent and gently swirl until buffer and
detergent are mixed. Avoid creating bubbles.
5. To the cylinder add 5 g of finely sliced celery. Ifthe pieces are stuck to the
sides, push them down into the buffer solution.
6. Make a note of the volume in each cylinder and record it in your data
sheet. This is essential to calculate the rate of reaction.
7. If you are completing more than one test label each cylinder according to the
test it belongs to, and set the timer for 15 minutes.
8. To the measuring cylinder add 2 mL 10% hydrogen peroxide and immediately
start the timer.
9. Note the volume of foam created in the measuring cylinder and record it
in your datasheet after 5, 10 & 15 minutes.
