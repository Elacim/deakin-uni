- Catalase - why is it necessary?
	- Protects cells from 'oxidative damage by reactive oxygen species'
	- (1; Section 2.4.6)
	- 2 hydrogen peroxide as a substrate to catalase produces 2 water and an O2 (7; para 3)

- Where does Hydrogen peroxide come from?
	- Redox enzymes will readily transfer electrons to O2, forming O2- and Hydrogen peroxide. This is thought to be accidental as the studied redox enzymes (flavins) were intended to act on other substrates.
		- Happens during aerobic respiration when O2 steals electrons intended for NAD+/FAD (2: page 398 and 3: 11.3.4)

- What organisms? Where is it in the organisms?
	- Organisms that have the ability to respirate (primarily Aerobic organisms but also facultative  anaerobes (4; Section 4) such as E. Coli. Facultative anaerobes are anaerobes that can undergo aerobic respiration and won't die in the presence of oxygen. (4; page 1)
	- That said, not all aerobic organisms have catalase (**REFERENCE**) and there are some anaerobic organisms that can survive oxygen exposure due to the superoxide dismutase enzyme (known as SOD) neutralising superoxide but not hydrogen peroxide (5; para 2) 

- Consequences of not removing Hydrogen Peroxide (6; para 4 and 2; 'Iron and oxidative damage')
	- Small size means easy permeability into membranes
	- Once Hydrogen peroxide reacts with iron, the produced hydroxide ions readily disrupt DNA 
	- Interestingly, our body uses Hydrogen peroxide to kill pathogens, ants use it as an anti-fungal, and plants use it to limit herbivore munching
