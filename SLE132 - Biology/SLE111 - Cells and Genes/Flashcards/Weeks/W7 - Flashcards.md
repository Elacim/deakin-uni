## Definitions
Inheritance :: The transmission of traits from one generation to the next
Gene :: A heritable unit that determines a character and can exist in different forms; a sequence of nucleotides
Character :: An observable heritable feature that may vary among individuals, such as flower colour
Trait :: One of two or more detectable variants in a genetic character, such as flower colour being white or purple

True breeding :: An individual that produces offspring of the same variety when they self-pollinate
Hybridisation :: Mating or crossing of two true-breeding individuals
<!--SR:!2023-09-22,2,248-->
Recombinant chromosome :: The product of crossing two chromosomes
How often do chromosomes crossover per pair? :: Anywhere from 1-3 times, dependent on size and centromere position
Polygenic :: A characteristic that is affected by two or more genes

#### Mendel's Four Concepts
Alternate versions of genes account for ... in inherited ... :: Alternate versions of genes account for **variations** in inherited **characters**
For each character in an organism, it inherits two ... :: For each **character** in an organism, it inherits two **alleles**
<!--SR:!2023-09-21,1,228-->
When two ... at a locus differ, the ... ... determines the organism's active trait :: When two **alleles** at a **locus** differ, the **dominant** **allele** determines the organism's active trait
Two ... for a heritable ... segregate during gamete formation and end up in differing gametes :: Two **alleles** for a heritable **character** segregate during **gamete** formation and end up in differing **gametes**
<!--SR:!2023-09-21,1,228-->
#### Generations
$P$ generation :: Parental individuals from which F1 hybrid offspring are derived
<!--SR:!2023-09-23,3,268-->
$F1$ generation :: Hybrid offspring arising from a parental ($P$ gen.)
$F2$ generation :: Offspring resulting from an interbreeding/self-pollination of the hybrid $F1$ generation
<!--SR:!2023-09-21,1,228-->
What does $Fx$ mean? :: The generation deriving from the previous generations, starting at the parental; filial meaning 'son'
What does the $F$ mean in regards to generations? :: Filial, which means 'son' in Latin

#### Genes
Allele :: An alternate form of a gene (like hair colour being blonde or brunette)
Locus :: Location of each gene in a chromosome
Dominant allele :: A fully expressed allele in the phenotype of a heterozygote
Recessive allele :: An allele whose phenotype does not show up in a heterozygote
Zygosity :: 
Homozygote :: Organisms with two identical alleles for a certain character (gene). True-breeding.
Heterozygote :: Organisms with two differing alleles for a certain character (gene). Not true-breeding.
Genotype :: An organism's genetic makeup ("internal nature")
<!--SR:!2023-09-22,2,248-->
Phenotype :: The observable physical and physiological traits of an organism which are determine by it's genotype ("external resemblance")

If a gene for hair colour is situated at a specific locus on two chromosomes, what are the chromosomes known as? :: Homologous chromosomes
<!--SR:!2023-09-23,3,250-->

Law of Segregation :: Two alleles for a heritable character separate (segregate) during gamete formation and end up in differing gametes
During gamete production, the gametes produced will only get one of the two alleles present per character/gene. This is also known as the law of {{segregation}} :: The Law of Segregation
Law of Independent Assortment :: 

## Punnett Squares
What is a genotypic ratio? :: It shows the *number* of differing alleles, such as 1PP:2Pp:1pp
<!--SR:!2023-09-22,2,248-->
What is a phenotypic ratio? :: The written out differing alleles, such as 3 purple : 1 white
Meaning of an organism with a 'dominant phenotype but unknown genotype' :: We know the organism has a dominant allele, such as for Purple (P), but we don't know if it has two dominant alleles (PP) or is heterozygous (Pp/pP); "one definite dominant, one unsure"
Meaning of an organism with a 'homozygous recessive genotype and phenotype' :: We know the organism has two alleles that are recessive, such as white (pp); "dual recessive alleles".

What do Punnett squares show? :: The possible sperm-egg combinations
What is the genotypic ratio in a monohybrid cross? :: A monohybrid cross always results in a 3:1 ratio
Is PP homozygous? :: Yes. It contains two of the same allele for the same character.
<!--SR:!2023-09-23,3,268-->
Is pp homozygous? :: Yes. It contains two of the same allele for the same character.
Is Pp homozygous? :: No. It contains two differing alleles for the same character, it is therefore heterozygous
Is pP homozygous? :: No. It contains two differing alleles for the same character, it is therefore heterozygous
What would the genotypic and phenotypic ratio of the $F_{1}$ generation of RR $\times$ rr be (wrinkled=R/round=r)? :: 100% Rr/4Rr/1Rr -> 4 wrinkled.
<!--SR:!2023-09-22,2,248-->
What would the genotypic ratio of the $F_{2}$ generation of RR $\times$ rr be (wrinkled=R/round=r)? :: $F_{1}$=4Rr -> $F_{2}=$ 1RR : 2Rr : 1rr -> 3 wrinkled, 1 round
<!--SR:!2023-09-22,2,248-->

The genetic makeup `NnEe` has a few possible gametes. Which of `NN; Ne; NE; & nE` is not possible? :: `NN`. There is no situation in `NnEe` where there will be two dominant `N`s

#### Testcross
What is the purpose of a testcross? :: To find the genotype with the dominant phenotype
<!--SR:!2023-09-21,1,230-->
How does a testcross work? :: By crossing a known homozygous recessive (p & p) with a singly-dominant and unsure dominant/recessive (P & P/p) organism, the results will either be ($F_{1}=Pp=100\%P$) or ($F_{1}=Pp/pp=50\%P$ and ($50\%p$). From this, we can determine if the parent is homo (100% Pp) or heterozygous (1P:1p)
<!--SR:!2023-09-22,2,248-->

#### Monohybrid cross
[Monohybrid cross explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2J5v861CTI)
Monohybrid cross meaning :: Breeding of two heterozygous parents with a single gene (such as `Pp x Pp`)
What is the genotypic ratio displayed in **mono**hybrid crosses? :: `1:2:1`
What does the `1:2:1` genotypic ratio represent? :: `1` dominant/dominant; `2` dominant/recessive; and `1` recessive/recessive
What does the `3:1` phenotypic ratio represent? :: `3` dominant : `1` recessive

#### Dihybrid cross
Dihybrids ::: Crossing two heterozygous (hybrid) parents (such as `YyRr x YyRr`) differing in two characters produces these in the $F_{1}$ generation
Dihybrid meaning :: **Di-** refers to two genes and **-hybrid** refers mixing heterozygous genotype. Therefore, **dihybrid** means two breeding organisms that are heterozygous for two separate genes
What is the purpose of dihybrid crosses? :: To determine the genotypic and phenotypic combinations of offspring for two unlinked genes
Explain the FOIL method and apply it to `AaBb` :: First Outside, Inside Last. Take the first (`A & B`), then the outside (`A & b`), then the inside (`a & B`), and finally, the last (`a & b`)
FOIL: Combine `A` with both `B` and `b`, then combine `a` with `B/b`
How many different gametes can `YyRr` produce? :: 4. `YR, Yr, yR, and yr`
How would the `YyRr x YyRr` dihybrid cross look (don't draw it)? :: There would be `YR Yr yR yr` on the top and on the side.
What is the genotypic ratio displayed in dihybrid crosses? :: `9:3:3:1`
What does the `9:3:3:1` genotypic ratio represent? :: 9 = dominant/dominant; 3 = Dominant/recessive; 3 = recessive/Dominant; and 1 = recessive/recessive
Dihybrid heterozygous cross :: `9:3:3:1`
What does it mean if a dihybrid cross does not follow the `9:3:3:1` ratio? :: There may be a extraneous factor like genetic mutation, errors etc. 
<!--SR:!2023-09-23,3,268-->

#### Multi-gene cross
[Multi-Gene Genetics Problems explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aNP3p_oHT8)
What is a multi-gene cross? :: The breeding of parents with more than two genes, such as `AABbCcDd x AaBbccDD`
How do you calculate proportions from multi-gene crosses? :: Break down the genes into multiple punnet squares and calculate those probabilities.  Multiply all the probabilities to get the proportion.
<!--SR:!2023-09-21,1,228-->
What proportion of the offspring of `AABbCcDd x AaBbccDD` would be `AABBCcDd`?
?
`AA=homo; BB=homo; Cc=hetero; Dd=hetero`
`AA x aa` -> `AA`=`2/4 AA`
`Bb x Bb` -> `BB`=`1/4 BB`
`Cc x cc`=`2/4 Cc`
`Dd x DD`=`2/4 Dd`
$\frac{2}{4} \times \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{2}{4} \times \frac{2}{4} = \frac{8}{256}=\frac{1}{32}$
There is a $\frac{1}{32}$ chance that the offspring will be `AABBCcDd`

How many unique gametes could be produced via independent assortment by an individual with the genotype `AaBBCCDdeeFfHH`?
?
```
AaBBCCDdeeFfHH
2 1 1 2 1 2 1 possibilities
Homozygous = 1 possibility; hetero = 2

Multiply all the possibilities:
2*1*1*2*1*2*1  (or instead cross out all homozygous chromosomes)
= 2*2*2 = 8 possible unique gametes
```
