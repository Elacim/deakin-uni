The purpose of water in the body
??
- Provides a space for biochemical reactions to occur
- allows transportation of nutrients, $O_2$, misc. molecules
- helps cells maintain structure by resisting external pressure ('pushing' outwards)
- allows lipid bilayers to form
- product of DNA and protein assemblage and through hydrolysis, can break apart them too
- a protection against acids and bases (giving up a $H->OH^-$, gaining a $H->H_3O^+$)
- photosynthesis (plants only)
**Nice to know:**
- theorised to assist amino acid and protein folding
- assists DNA to stay structured while replicating

<!--SR:!2023-08-01,3,251!2023-08-02,4,271-->

#### pH
pH :: Potential of Hydrogen, calculated with the formula $-log(H^+)$. Acidic (0) to alkaline (14). A pH of 7 is considered to be neutral.
<!--SR:!2023-08-02,4,271-->

What do acids release when dissolved in water? :: $H^+$ (hydrogen) ions. e.g. Hydrochloric acid: $HCl_{(aq)}+H_2O_{(l)}\xrightarrow{H_2O} H^+_{(aq)}+Cl^-_{(aq)}+\text{Heat}$
<!--SR:!2023-08-13,15,270-->

What do bases release when dissolved in water? :: $OH^-$ (hydroxide) ions. e.g. Sodium hydroxide: $NaOH_{(aq)}+H_2O_{(l)}\xrightarrow{H_2O}OH^-+Na^+$

Why are hydroxide ($OH^{-}$) and hydrogen ($H^{+}$) ions so reactive? :: Due each ion having a $\pm\delta$, they want to be in a more stable electron configuration ($OH^{-}$ wants a $+\delta$ and $H^{+}$ a $-\delta$). For this reason too, they readily attract and form a water molecule ($OH^{-}+H^{+} \rightarrow H_{2}O$)
<!--SR:!2023-08-14,16,270-->
[Source - North Arizona University](https://www2.nau.edu/lrm22/lessons/acids_and_bases/acids_and_bases.html)

What ions are the result of an acid/base reacting with water? :: An acid will produce $H^{+}$ (hydrogen cations) and a base $OH^-$ (hydroxide anion) 
<!--SR:!2023-08-02,4,271-->

What is a neutralisation reaction? 
?
When an acid and a base combine, they neutralise and always produce $H_2O$ and a neutral ionic compound known as a *salt*. 
e.g. $HCl+NaOH\rightarrow H_2O+NaCl$. 
	-> $H^{+}+OH^{-}\rightarrow H_{2}O$
	-> $Na^{+}+Cl^{-}\rightarrow NaCl$
e.g. $CaCO_{3}+2HCl \rightarrow H_{2}O+CaCl_{2}+CO_{2}$

###### Evolution

How are females and males split ~50/50?
?
The leading theory is [Fisher's Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_principle) which works both in a low male:female ratio and a high male:female ratio.
1. With a 30:70 ratio of males:females, males will have more females to mate with, leading to more offspring
2. Parents with a predisposition to pump out males will usually then have more offspring, making the genes responsible for male-birth more common and therefore male births more common
3. This will slowly ease the ratio into a 1:1 and thereby eliminating the associated advantages with male births (more offspring) and causing those genes to recess.
