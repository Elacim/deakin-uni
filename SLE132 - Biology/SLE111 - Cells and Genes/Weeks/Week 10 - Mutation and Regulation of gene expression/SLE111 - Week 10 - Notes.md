What does the following mRNA sequence code for? `AUG CCG GGG UAC UAA` :: Methionine (start)-Proline-Glycine-Tyrosine-STOP

What does the following DNA sequence code for? `AGG CTT AAA GTC GTA` :: First, convert it to mRNA (`UCC GAA UUU CAG CAU`), then: Serine-Glutamic Acid-Phenylalanine-Glutamine-Histidine

Where would the DNA sequence `AGG CTT AAA GTC GTA` be located? :: Likely in the middle of a gene as there is no START nor STOP codon

`CAG TCG AGC AGT GCG AGC ACA GAA CGT GTA AAC TGG TGA`
### Mutations
What is a mutation? :: A change in a nucleotide sequence of the genetic material of a cell or virus
Do mutations always affect the phenotype? :: No, they can have no effect
If a polypeptide -> may result in changes
Mutations in gametes/germ line are transmitted through generations
Mutations in somatic cells are not inherited
What causes mutations? :: Random chance and mutagens

#### Large-scale mutations
- large segments of chromosomes
- large scale rearrangement or non-disjunction of entire chromosomes

Insertion :: Insertion of nucleotide(s) within a chromosomal segment 
Deletion :: Removal of nucleotide(s) within a chromosomal segment
Consequences of insertion and deletion :: The 'reading frame' is altered if not in a multiple of 3 (nucleotides)

Duplication :: Repetition of nucleotides within a chromosomal segment
Inversion :: Inversion of nucleotides within a chromosomal segment
Translocation :: The movement of segments from one chromosome to a nonhomologous chromosome
Reciprocal translocation :: The swapping of one (non-homologous) chromosome's material to another non-homologous chromosome
Non-reciprocal translocation :: The transference of a chromosome's material to another without receiving any in return

###### Silent
Nucleotide change leads to the same amino acid

###### Missense
Nucleotide change leads to a different amino acid

###### Nonsense
Nucleotide change codes for a STOP codon

###### Frameshift
What is a frameshift mutation? :: The mutation of a genetic sequence where read proteins 
Consequences of frameshift mutations in multiple of 3 :: It depends on the amino acid and what the purpose of it is. If it comprises the mass, it would not have a drastic effect whereas if it comprised the active site, it would be devastating

**Slide 13b**
What is Thalassemia? :: The abnormal production of haemoglobin
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ version


#### Mutagens
Mutagen :: Agents that increase the rate of mutations
Are all mutagens harmful? :: Some may be beneficial and provide genetic variation in a population
Examples of physical mutagens :: UV and ionising radiation
Examples of chemical agents :: Chemicals that interact with DNA ($H_{2}O_{2}+Fe(II)$)

**Slide 15a**
Cancer cells usually have {{mutations}} in genes involved in cell growth or cell division :: Mutations
What are most cancers caused by? :: Environmental factors
What is the purpose of the p53 gene? :: To suppress tumours
What would a faulty p53 gene potentially cause? :: Cancer
What type of cells are involved in cancers? :: Any somatic cell
What type of cells cause human genetic disorders? :: Germ line (gamete) mutations

What is a proto-oncogene? :: A regular functioning gene involved in cell growth and division that when mutated or with too many copies has the potential to cause cancer (i.e. become an oncogene)
What is an oncogene? :: A gene with the potential to cause cancer
What is the effect of a gene involved in cell growth/division being mutated? :: It is not guaranteed but it can cause cancer
Aside from causing cancer, what are the effects of oncogenes? :: They can result in excess production of proteins that stimulate growth; they can become hyperactive; and/or become degradation resistant


Why do different cells have different properties when they all contain the same genome? :: 
Not all genes function at the same time - some are never expressed/active
Gene expression depends on the life stage of a cell
Proks and Euks adapt in response to the environment
	Gene expressions regulates development and is responsible for differences in cell types
BACTERIA - **SLIDE 18b**
Eukaryotic gene expression is significantly more complex

Gene expression regulation is vital in embryonic development
Only ~20% of genes are expressed/cell
As an embryo develops, cells become more specialised (stem cells) - only certain types of genes are active/cell

**SLIDE 20a**
Packaging levels in chromosomes influences activity
Types of chromatin :: Euchromatin and heterochromatin
Euchromatin :: The less condensed form of chromatin available for transcription
Heterochromatin :: The highly condensed form of chromatin that appears during interphase, and is generally not transcribed
How does heterochromatin block enzyme transcription? :: It being so tightly packed physically blocks enzymes

What is histone acetylation? :: The addition of acetyl-groups to the amino acid lysine in found in the tail of histones
What does histone acetylation do? :: It loosens chromatin and prevents the histones from aggregating and therefore allowing or improving transcription
What is DNA methylation? :: The addition of methyl groups to certain DNA bases
What is the purpose of DNA methylation? :: To inactivate genes in cellular differentiation
Is DNA methylation permanent? :: Not necessary, but the genes can remain inactive even through successive mitotic divisions

Epigenome :: The addition or subtraction of chemical compounds (like methyl groups) to DNA that modify or mark the genome 
Epigenetics :: The changes in gene expression over a lifespan
True or False: More 'negative' epigenetic markers than positive are kept during deprogramming :: True. The studies are inconclusive as to why that is happening though. 
Epigenetic inheritance :: The inheritance of traits to daughter cells not directly involving the nucleotide sequence
Is all epigenetic information permanent? :: Not necessarily, it can be passed on but it is also somewhat stripped when going from generation to generation 
Examples of ? :: The inheritance of chromatin modifications or the X-chromosome inactivation in females influenced by epigenetic factors
- changes are permanent
- modifications to the chromatin can be reversed
- DNA methylation patterns are removed and re-established during gamete formatino (named deprogramming)
Factors influencing genetic changes :: Environmental exposure, diet, stress, lifestyle

What effect does smoking have on future generations? :: Known as transgenerational effects, a grandmother smoking while pregnant will have their child's sex organs affected, leading to effects in this new mother and their child.

What enzyme carries out genetic transcription? :: RNA polymerase
What type of proteins does RNA polymerase depend on? :: Proteins called transcription factors
- General transcription factors are essential for all protein-coding gene transcription
- high levels -> controls elements interacting with specific transcription factors
Transcription factors named *activators* bind to the DNA control elements (*enhancers*) which are located upstream (~200 bases) from the regular - though far, they still regulate transcription

![[Enhancers, RNA polymerase, transcription factors, promoters.png]]

Model of action of enhancers - Slide 8a
![[Model of action of enhancers.png]]

transcription factors
Only if all activator proteins are bound to enhancers  (e.g. if only 1/3 are present, it won't transcribe the gene)

![[Activation from transcription factors.png]]

What do repressors do? :: They inhibit expression of a particular gene
Where do repressors bind? :: They bind to control elements and block activator binding
**SLIDE 9b**
Post-transcriptional regulation :: 

Alternative RNA splicing - different mRNA molecules are produced from the same primary transcript depending on how they are spliced. Different exons are included. One gene can therefore produce more then one polypeptide chain

**mRNA degradation**
mRNA from differing genes have differing lifespans
	- lifespan in cytoplasm -> key to determination of protein synthesis
True or false: Eukaryotic mRNA is longer lived than prokaryote mRNA :: True
What is mRNA lifespan determined by? :: Determined in part by leader/trailer regions (nucleotides)
What is the purpose of mRNA having a short lifespan? :: It allows the organism to rapidly adapt to it's changing needs 

What regulates the breakdown of mRNA? :: The shortening of the poly-a tail
Some mRNA is degraded quickly, only being translated a few times
	Common in bacteria
	Allows quick response to environmental changes
Some last for weeks - globin mRNA are translated many times

**Transitional regulation**
Regulation can be at the levels of translation
Not all mRNAs will be translated - initiation is blocked by regulatory proteins
mRNA may be stored in mammal eggs, waiting until fertilisation before activation
What does MiRNA mean? :: Micro RNA

MiRNA (micro RNA) regulates translation by binding to the small RNA molecules
	If all bases are complementary to the MiRNA, the mRNA is degraded
	If not 1:1 complementary, translation is blocked

Development and differentiation in an embryo
	- uneven distribution of cytoplasmic components and signal induction from developing cells -> differential gene expression
	- determined by sequential program of gene regulation that's carried out as embryonic cells divide

What is a 3' UTR? :: A 3-prime untranslated region
What is a 5' UTR? :: A 5-prime untranslated region

**Post-translational modification - slide 12b** LOOK AT PICTURE
When does post-translational modification occur? :: Mechanisms involved occur after translation
What does post-translational modification usually involve? :: It often involves cutting polypeptides into smaller, active final products
Why does post-translation modification occur? :: Some proteins may be constructed in an inactive form
What is an example of post-translation modification occur? :: Insulin, it is a single chain that must be cleaved to activate 
Some proteins are modified after they have been synthesised
Some proteins are constructed as inactive - e.g. insulin is a single chain that needs to be cleaved, and many proteins also have sugar residues added to them


## Viruses
What do viruses consist of? :: Nucleic acids, a protein coat, 1-2 enzymes, glycoprotein spikes, some with envelope membranes (stolen from hosts)
How do viruses 'infect'? :: The insert their genetic material into cells, using it as a factory
What do virsues use to reproduce? :: The host enzymes, ribosomes, tRNA, amino acids, ATP, and other molecules
How do viruses form after being produced? :: The newly created viral nucleic acid molecules and capsomeres spontaneously sself-assemble into new viruses
Are viruses considered as life? :: No, they are completely dependent on host cells
What are viruses? :: Non-cellular parasites
What types of nucleic acids do viruses contain? :: Anything - double-stranded DNA/RNA, single-stranded DNA/RNA, linear/circular

slide 15a
Capsid? Protein coat
What is a capsomere? :: 
15b-16b - different virus shapes
What is the shape of the tobacco mosaic virus? :: Vaguely cylinder
What is the shape of adenoviruses? :: Hexagonal/Tetrahedral 
What is the shape of influenza? :: Roughly circular
What is the shape of bacteriophages? :: Lil' spiders


Double stranded DNA reproductions
- Lytic cycle :: The virus reproduces and lyses the cells
	- Virus injects own DNA and recycles the host components into virus
	- Best for quick and dirty proliferation
1. Attachment of virus to host
2. Insertion of phage DNA; degradation of host DNA
3. Synthesis of viral genomes and proteins
4. Virus assembly
5. Cell lysis

**SLIDE 18a**
- Lysogenic cycle :: The virus integrates into the host genome
	- Virus (prophage) injects own DNA and host reproduces/splits 
	- Best for amassing incredible amounts of viruses

### Bacteria defence mechanisms
As bacteria are unicellure -> they must survive a bacteriophage attack
Bacteria with surface proteins that are not recognised by phage receptors
Phage receptors determine pathogenicity
- When phage DNA enters bacterium, foreign DNA is cut up into smaller pieces by cellular enzymes
	- Restriction enzymes restrict a phage's ability to replicate (it knows how to deal with it)
CRISPR-Cas system **Slide 19b-20a**
- repetitive DNA sequences
- Invading phage DNA is broken down and integrated into host genome between two repeat regions
	- Cas-9 complex keeps an RNA copy of this which assists to identify new phage DNA
	- allows post-transcriptional removal and degradation of the phage DNA
	- 
Homology repair
TED talk - how CRISPR lets you edit dna - Andrea M Henle


### HIV - slide 24a-b
Retrovirus - use RNA to make DNA
HIV components :: Glycoprotein spikes; viral envelope; capsid; two identical RNA strands; reverse transcriptase
Glycoprotein spikes attach to receptors on lymphocyte cell membranes
HIV fully enters the cell

Integrated DNA is transcribed and translated to form new virus proteins
	- the cell is now 'empty' and only produces viruses

### Single-stranded RNA (RNA -> DNA)
Retroviruses are RNA viruses that use animal DNA as an intermediate
	- RNA to DNA instead of the usual DNA to RNA
		- Done using reverse transcriptase enzyme to achieve this conersion
	- high mutation rates and short generation times - they can respond quickly to the body's defence mechanisms

Herpes virus (cold sores) - leave mini-chromosomes
	- triggered by stress
	- HIV inserts DNA copy of it's genetic material into host cell chromosomes

### Differences in viral protection
Smallpox and polio have a mutation rate 100x slower than HIV
	- Allowing a vaccine to be made before it mutates into an unrecognisable strain
1. Introduce non-functioning virus into the body
2. Human immune cells develop defences against the virus
3. IF an organism is then infected with an active virus -> defence is already in place so it's killed before hefty multiplication

### Beneficial viruses
Some viruses (oncolyticviruses) can help with destroying viruses
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332641944_Oncolytic_Viruses_and_Immune_Checkpoint_Inhibition_The_Best_of_Both_Worlds

### Viroids
Pieces of circular nucleic acid (RNA)
Primarily infect plant cells and disrupt normal growth

### Prions
Infectious proteins
Cause degenerative brain diseases (mad cow, Creutzfield-Jacob, Kuru disease)
- ingested in food and not destroyed by cooking (more common in countries with poor agricultural controls)
- Slow acting (10 years until first symptoms)
- No known cure
- Enter brain cells and convert normal protein to an abnormal form, in turn killing cells as there are no normal proteins
