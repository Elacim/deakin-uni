Gregor Mendel
	- first person to analyse patterns of inheritance
	- 'father of genetics'
	- conducted numerous experiments w/ pea plants
	- Peas were chosen for their many distinct characterisitics or traits (flower colour, seed colour)
		- mating can be controlled
			- each only has stamen and carpels
		- cross-pollination can be achieved by dusting
	- He tracked characters the displayed either-or behaviour (like colour - either purple or white)
		- used true-breeding flowers (only white and only purple),
			- bred them > all $F1$ flowers were purple
				- $F2$ were 75% purple and 25% white
				- slide 6b for full graph
				- From this, he reasoned that the purple flower factor was affecting flower colour in $F1$
					- purple flower colour = dominant trait, white flower colour = recessive trait
				- He named this 'heritable factors' - what we now know as genes
Mendel's concepts
Concept 1
- alt versions of genes account for variations in inherited characters
	- e.g. gene for flower colour in pea plants exists as white or purple
		- this in particular is chosen by a cytosine being a adenine
Concept 2
- for each char. an organism, it inherits two alleles
	- one from each parent
	- Mendel made this deduction w/o knowing about chromosomes
- the two alleles at a locus on a chromosome may be identical or different

Concept 3
- if two alleles at a locus differ
	- dominant allele determines the organism's appearance
	- recessive allele has no noticeable effect on appearance
- - $F1$ plants had purple flowers - because it is dominant
- - $F2:F1$ ratio shows the differences
slide 11a

Concept 4
- law of segregation - two alleles for a heritable character separate (segregate) during gamete formation and end up in differing gametes
- therefore, and egg or sperm get onnly one of the two alleles that are present in the somatic cells of an organism

Why is DNA a double helix? Error correction?


Gene :: A heritable unit that determines a character and can exist in different forms
Character :: An observable heritable feature that may vary among individuals
Trait :: One of two or more detectable variants in a genetic character
True breeding :: An individual that produces offspring of the same variety when they self-pollinate
Hybridisation :: Mating or crossing of two individuals

$P$ generation :: Parental individuals from which F1 hybrid offspring are derived
$F1$ generation :: Hybrid offspring arising from a parental ($P$ gen.)
$F2$ generation :: Offspring resulting from an interbreeding/self-pollination of the hybrid $F1$ generation
What does $Fx$ mean? :: The generation deriving from the previous generations, starting at the parental

Allele :: An alternate form of a gene (like hair colour being blonde or brunette)
Locus :: Location of each gene in a chromosome
Dominant allele :: A fully expressed allele in the phenotype of a heterozygote
Recessive allele :: An allele whose phenotype does not show up in a heterozygote
Zygosity :: 
Homozygote :: Organisms with two identical alleles for a certain character (gene). True-breeding.
Heterozygote :: Organisms with two differing alleles for a certain character (gene). Not true-breeding.
Genotype :: An organism's genetic makeup
Phenotype :: The observable physical and physiological traits of an organism which are determine by it's genotype
Due to dominant and recessive alleles having different chances, an organism's traits do not always reveal it's composition

Monohybrid cross :: A cross between individuals heterozygous

# Part B
Predicting genetic outcomes
	- Punnet squares
Punnett squares show the possible combinations of sperm and egg
	- One letter/gene
	- Lowercase=recessive, uppercase=dominant
	- Choose whatever letters but avoid letters that look similar between cases (e.g. c and C, s and S, p and P)

|     | P   | p   | overall |
| --- | --- | --- | ------- |
| P   | PP  | Pp  | PP/Pp=3 |
| p   | pP  | pp  | pp=1    |
Monohybrid cross - always results in 3:1 ratio
PP and pp are homozygous
Pp and pP are heterozygous
Note: 'pP' is for demonstrating, it should be 'Pp'
Genotypical ratio -> 1AA : 2:Aa : 1aa
Phenotypical ratio -> 3 purple : 1 white

How do we figure out the genotype with the dominant phenotype
	- testcross
Testcross
	- breed mystery individual w/ a homozygous recessive individual
	- If any offpsring display the recessive phenotype, the mystery parent must be heterozygous (Pp)
	- If the offspring only display the dominant phenotype, the mystery parent must be homozygous (PP)
How do you determine the genotype of a mystery individual? :: Using a testcross
![[test-cross-1_med.jpeg]]

- Work out parent alleles (R=round seeds, r=wrinkled seeds).
	- They are homozygous
	- $P$ generation
$F1$ generation $\downarrow$

|     | R   | R   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| r   | Rr  | Rr  |
| r   | Rr  | Rr  |
Genotype ratio: 4Rr or 100% Rr or 1Rr. These seeds would look round. 
Phenotype ratio: 100% round or 1 round  (all squares are Rr - they all have a dominant gene)

$F_{2}$ generation $\downarrow$

|     | R   | r   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R   | RR  | Rr  |
| r   | Rr  | rr  |
Genotype ratio: 1RR : 2Rr : 1rr
Phenotype ratio: 3 round, 1 wrinkled

Dihybrids :: Crossing two true-breeding parents differing in two characters produces these in the $F_{1}$ generation
Dihybrid crosses between $F_{1}$ hybrids can determine whether two characters are transmitted to offspring as a package (like are peas only ever round & yellow or green & wrinkled?) or independently (round & yellow, green & wrinkled, round & green, and wrinkled & yellow) 
- During gamete formation - each pair of alleles segregates independently 
- Only applies to genes on different, non-homologous chromosomes
- Genes located near each other on the same chromosome tend to be inherited together - linked genes
- If the genes follow Mendelian inheritance patterns, they will demonstrate a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio
	- If not, then these genes do not follow the laws of independent assortment

Parent gen: TTPP $\times$ ttpp simplifies to TP $\times$ tp
TTPP -> The only gamete than can result is TP as they are the only dominant ones
times ttpp -> tp

|     | TP   |
| --- | ---- |
| tp  | TtPp |
Genotype: 100% TtPp
Phenotype: Tall and purple flower

$F_{1}$ gen -> TtPp $\times$ TtPp
Take the first from each pair (TP)
Take the first and 4th (Tp)
Take the inner pair (tP)
Take the 2nd and 4th (tp)
Gametes $\downarrow$

|     | TP   | Tp   | tP   | tp   |
| --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| TP  | TTPP | TTPp | TtPP | TtPp |
| Tp  | TTPp | TTpp | TtPp | Ttpp |
| tP  | TtPP | TtPp | ttPP | ttPp |
| tp  | TtPp | Ttpp | ttPp | ttpp |

1 TTPP : 2TTPp : 2TtPP : 4TtPp : 3Ttpp : 3ttPp : 1ttpp
-> 9TP : 3Tp : 3tP : 1tp 
9 tall and purple plants
3 tall and white plant
3 short and purple plants
1 short and white plant
(9:3:3:1 ratio)

Alleles of one gene segregate into gametes independently of another gene's alleles

In AaBbcc $\times$ AabbCC, what is the probability of obtaining offspring that show all three dominant traits?
Aa $\times$ Aa; Bb $\times$ bb; cc $\times$ CC

|     | A   | a   |     |     | B   | b   |     |     | c   | c   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A   | AA  | Aa  |     | b   | Bb  | bb  |     | C   | Cc  | Cc  |
| a   | Aa  | aa  |     | b   | Bb  | bb  |     | C   | Cc  | Cc  |
|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

Probability of (AA or Aa) = $\frac{3}{4}$
Probability of (Bb or Bb) = $\frac{1}{2}$
Probability of (CC or Cc) = $\frac{1}{1}$
$\frac{3 \times 1 \times 1}{4 \times 2 \times 1}= \frac{3}{8} \approx 37\%$ of all three dominant traits being shown at the same time

How many unique gametes could be produced through independent assortment by an individual with the genotype of AaBBCCDdeeFfHH
```
AaBBCCDdeeFfHH
2 1 1 2 1 2 1 possibilities
Aa = two possibilities
BB = one possibility

Multiply all the possibilities:
2*1*1*2*1*2*1  (or instead cross out all homozygous chromosomes)
= 2*2*2 = 8

```
