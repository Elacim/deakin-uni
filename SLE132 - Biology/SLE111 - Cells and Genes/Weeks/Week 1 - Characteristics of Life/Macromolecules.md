- thousands-millions of covalently bonded atoms
	- Polymer -> many similar building blocks
		- Monomer -> a single building block
	-Carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids (all true polymers), and lipids (non-polymer)


##### Carbohydrates
 - sugars (monosaccharides) and polymers of sugars (polysaccharides)
	- Glucose (monosaccharide)
		- Major source of energy
		- Builds up to the important starch (energy storage), glycogen, and cellulose (structural form - cell walls in plants)
	- Disaccharide -> 2 monosaccharides joined together through a dehydration reaction

#### Lipids
 - hydrophobic (fats, cholesterol, sex hormones, cell membranes). 
	- Made of glycerol and tail made of fatty acids
	- Phospholipid (hydrophillic head, hydrophobic tail -> meaning they're amphipathic)
		- Self assemble in water
			- Micelle (a circle of phospholipids)
			- Phospholipid bilayer
	- Saturation
		- Saturated: Tail is single bonds (straight). Solid at room temp. Tends to come from animals.
			- SSS - *S*aturated, *s*traight tail, *s*olid at room temp.
		- Unsaturated: Mostly single then a double bond kinks it. Liquid at room temp. Tends to be from plant fats and fish fats.
	- Major function of fats is energy storage
		- Stored in adipose cells
		- Cushions vital organs + insulates the body

#### Proteins
 - wide range of functions
	- Building blocks (monomers) are called amino acids
		- Sequence determines shape, and therefore the function	
 - Structural, storage, contractile (muscle contractions), transport (haemoglobin), hormonal, receptor, defensive
- 20 essential amino acids
- Structure
	- 1. Primary structure (amino acid strings)
	- 2. Secondary (alpha helix, beta pleated sheet)
	- 3. Tertiary (polypeptide)
	- 4. Quaternary (complete protein)
	
#### Nucleic acid - DNA & RNA
- Built from nucleotides
		- Phosphate - sugar - base
			- sugar = deoxyribose
			- phosphate and sugar form backbone
			- base is one of TA GC
				- Thymine and Adenine pair up
				- Guanine and Cytosine pair up
 - Store and transmit info (in the form of genes)
	- Protein synthesis
	- Made up of nucleotides
	- RNA - ribose, not deoxyribose
		- uracil instead of thymine (U instead of T)
		- single stranded
		- mRNA (messenger RNA) takes genetic info from DNA to ribosome
		- DNA -> mRNA -> RNA -> Protein
	- Transcription: DNA to mRNA
	- Translation: mRNA to polypeptide chain
	- 3 nucleotides encodes one amino acid
