What's causing blood to flow back into the heart? Purely pressure?

Can a contracted heart also have blood flowing into it?

Why do arterioles have decrease in blood pressure? Because capillaries are leading from them?

What is the purpose of the atrium - I mean, why can't we just go directly from vein/artery to ventricle?
Do the atrium create a seal? Why couldn't a blood vessel flap do the same?

Are lungs mostly the same?
- the same general thing with alveoli, tubes leading to them, capillaries leading out of them

Why does pressure build up in the lungs during exhalation?
