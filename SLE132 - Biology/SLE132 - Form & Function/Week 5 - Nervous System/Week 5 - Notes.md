Nervous and endocrine have strong structural, chemical, and functional relations
Endo and nervous both use hormones

Endocrine vs nervous
Nervous vs endocrine

| Nervous system                                       | Endocrine system                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Chemicals over small, electrical over long distances | Long distance travel with chemicals  |
| Small amounts of chemicals needed                    | Lots needed (lots of blood to cover) |
| Fast response                                        | Slow response                        |
| Brief (transitory) response                          | Prolonged response                   |
| Limited cellular targets                             | All cells with appropriate receptors |

Resting and action potential



![Process of action potential](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcdWs_sr7-Y)
**SLIDE 8b**
Charge of a resting membrane potential in a neuron :: -70mV
What common process can the resting membrane potential be likened to? :: A concentration gradient

What is the ratio of sodium ions pumped in to potassium ions pumped out? :: $3Na^{+}:2K^{+}$

1. Unequal distribution of ions across membrane (more $Na^{+}$ outside, $K^{+}$ inside)

When a stimuli is applied, the $Na^{+}$ gated channels open and cause the inside of the cell to flip, becoming positive and the outside negative
	This will continuously propagate down the axon if it reaches the threshold potential

[How synapses work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibzfwtdtong)
Nervous system - synapses (Crash Course biology)

[[Action potential]]

SSRIs, anti-anxieties mostly act at this point, preventing/promoting uptake 

Sodium-potassium pump :: Sodium out, potassium in


**-- Not assessable --**
Neurotransmitters
• Acetylcholine: Memory, learning, muscles
(sarin, botulinum-botox)
• Glutamate: CNS and PNS — long term memory
• GABA: inhibitory synapses in brain (Valium)
• Endorphins: natural analgesics (opium receptors)
• Nitrous Oxide: Blood vessel dilation (Viagra)
