##### Cyclic electron flow
Cyclic electron flow uses only photosystem I producing ATP • but not NADPH • Cyclic electron flow generates surplus ATP • satisfying the higher demand in the Calvin Cycle

Cyclic electron flow thought to have evolved first, before linear electron flow • May protect cells from light-induced damage
