On slide 5b, the cortical reaction is shown as occurring from the entry point of the sperm which is (only able to be) on the outside of the egg membrane. If the Endoplasmic Reticulum releases calcium 2+ ions, how are they starting at the edge of the membrane? 
- acrosomal reaction has receptors -> signal cascade to ER  

Isn't the ER always located around the nucleus? Perhaps it moves towards the location in those 10 seconds after [[Fertilisation]]?

What is the purpose of cortical granule contents causing the separation of the membrane and creating an osmotic gradient?
	Osmotic gradient -> cortical granule solute -> water rushes in to make a gap
	Separates membranes -> more distance between egg and the membrane
	Enzymes harden the vitelline layer, creating a physical barrier

What exactly is the yolk in the cells at the vegetal pole? Fat and stuff?
	And follow up, what is the fluid inside the blastocoel?
	- fatty nutritious yolk
	- yolk plug is butthole
	- 

When the sperm is fully sucked in by the egg, is it safe to say the tail is sort of digested and parts reused?
	- Yes, recycled
	- Aster

At what stage in embryonic development do the cells begin to differentriate?

Centrosome forms around the centriole which comes from the basal
body of flagellum of sperm. ??????
- Mostly the basal body -> centriole -> 

When is a zygote diploid in mammals? Is it just before the mitotic division? 
How about Echinoderms?

In gastrulation, does the blastopore form on any side of the blastula? I read something somewhere that said it formed on the vegetal pole. [[Gastrulation]]
- it forms roughly on the boundary

In the diagram for the end of gastrulation, 'Blastocoel remnant' is clearly marked - what effect does that have on the final embryo?
- nothing, just showing that it was there

Are the neural crest cells found on the neural fold before they're pinched inwards?
