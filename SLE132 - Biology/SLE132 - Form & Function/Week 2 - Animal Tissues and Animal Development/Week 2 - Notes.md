[[Hierarchy of Biological Organisation]] - Cells to tissues to organs to organ systems...

Tissues :: A group of cells with a common structure and function

### 4 main types of tissue
###### Epithelial
What is the most basic purpose of epithelial cells? :: To line external surfaces
What is the main condition for a part of the body having epithelial cells? :: It being exposed to the environment
Where are epithelial cells located? :: The skin, the digestive system, the respiratory system, and the circulatory system

Uses - protection, exchange (movement), secretion (Slide 4a)

Slide 4b
From where do new epithelial cells come from? :: The basal lamina
What is the purpose of the basal lamina? :: 

Slide 5a

What are the possible shapes of animal tissues? :: Squamous, cuboidal, and columnar
What are the possible layers of animals tissues? :: Simple, stratified, and pseudostratified

What is the shape of a squamous cell? :: Squished
What is the shape of a cuboidal cell? :: Cuboidal
What is the shape of a columnar cell? :: Rectangular (taller than wide)

How many layers in a simple cell? :: One
How many layers in a stratified cell? :: More than one
How many layers in a pseudostratified cell? :: One, though it can be the height of stratified

What are the two sides of epithelial cells? :: The apical and basal cells
Apical side meaning :: The side that faces the cavity or lumen (lumen = food way)
Basal side :: Attached to the basement membrane

Simple squamous - allows diffusion due to reduced size and simple layering
Simple columnar - intestines, secretes digestive juices, absorbs nutrients
Simple cuboidal - square cells, kidney tubules, glands, specialised for secretion

What are the characteristics of cartilage? :: Flexibility, non-rigid, 
Why is cartilage used? :: For when structural support AND movement is needed 

##### Bone - 9b
What is bone made of? :: A crystalline structure comprised of calcium, magnesium, and phosphate ions
What is the shape of bone? :: Circular layers

Osteo- suffix meaning :: Bone
Osteoblasts :: They build bone matrixes
Osteoclasts :: They breakdown bone
Osteocytes :: They release hormones and minerals
Osteogenic cell :: Stem cells that are precursors to osteoblasts/cytes

##### Blood
What is the tissue part of blood? :: The plasma
What is blood comprised of? :: Red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets
What is the main component of plasma? :: Water
What is blood used for? :: Transportation of substances like glucose and gases
Why is blood considered a tissue? :: A tissue is a group of cells with a common/similar purpose with a filling material in the middle. Red blood cells have a common goal and plasma is the filling material, so, blood is a tissue  

##### Nervous
What is the basic purpose of nervous tissue? :: To sense stimuli and transmit electrical signals 
[[Neurons]]
What is the purpose of Schwann cells? :: They produces myelin sheathe
##### Muscle - 13a
What does muscle tissue come
What are the three types of muscle tissues? :: Skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscle
What muscles are voluntarily controlled? :: Skeletal muscles
What are the shapes of muscle cells? :: Long but accordion like, meaning they can contract and extend

Which muscle type(s) have **no** striation? :: Smooth muscles
Which muscle type(s) **have** striation? :: Skeletal and cardiac muscles 

Skeletal muscle characteristics :: Striated cells, voluntary control
Smooth muscles characteristics :: No striations, distinct cells, involuntary
Cardiac muscle characteristics :: Striated, branching cells, involuntary

Which muscle has distinct cells? :: Smooth muscle
Which muscle has branching cells? :: Cardiac muscles
Which muscle has parallel fibres? :: Skeletal muscles

What gives the striation appearance? :: Contractile units that go along the length of the tissue fibres

# Class 2
What phylum has similar reproduction to Chordates? :: [[Echinodermata (Sea stars, Urchins, Cucumbers)]]
#### Sea urchins
Process of fertilisation :: Contact, acrosomal reaction, actin filaments, fusion, nucleus entry, cortical reaction
Contact :: Jelly coating is contacted
Acrosomal reaction :: Sperm releases enzymes to form holes in the jelly
Actin filaments :: Grow from sperm and bind to receptors on the egg
Fusion :: Sperm and egg membranes fuse and the membrane potential shifts (depolarises)
What is the purpose of membrane depolarisation? :: To prevent additional sperm-egg fusion
	Fast block to polyspermy (multiple sets of chromosomes = bad)

Cortical reaction :: Gamete fusion triggering calcium release from the [[Endoplasmic Reticulum]]
Cortical granules fuse w/ membrane, releaseing contents between vitelline space and egg membrane
	Separates membranes
	Osmotic gradient
	Enzymes harden the vitelline layer, creating a physical barrier
	Known as the slow block to polyspermy (more permanent)
- sperm tail sticks out
- very quick fertilisation time, fusing is fast
- The fertilisation envelope is present during blastula stages

#### Mammals
Egg surrounded by follicle cells
Zona Pellucida - egg's ECM, sperm receptacle
- 
No fast block to polyspermy, only slow block - therefore no membrane potential
- whole sperm is taken in as egg lacks centrosome
- Sperm mitochondria are reutilised as parts so they don't pass on genes
Centrosome forms around the centriole which comes from the basal body of flagellum of sperm.

Fertilisation time :: 12-36 hours
n + n meaning :: Fused sperm and egg separate chromosome sets
What happens during fertilisation? :: Nuclei stay distinct, nuclear membrane disperses, chromosomes attach to spindle -> mitotic division = diploid daughter cells

***Cleavage***
As cells divide, they become a ball of cells (each successive cell is smaller)
First, the morula - latin for raspberry/mulberry
Then the blastula (hollow ball), blastocyst in humans
Embryo does not enlarge - we aiming for dense
Blastocyst components :: 1+ layer of cells surrounding the blastocoel, a fluid-filled chamber, two poles (animal w/ smaller cells and vegetal pole w/ larger cells and yolk granules)
Different parts of the blastocyst contain... :: Different chemicals to form different parts of cells

**Gastrula - gastrulation**
- Cells rearrange to form 3-layered embryo
	- Excluding 2-layered invertebrates
Layered - different parts of an animal
1. Ectoderm (outer layer)
2. Endo (embryonic digestive tract)
3. Meso (middle layer)

Envagination - cell moves inwards, shrinking the blastocoel
Digestive cavity - archenteron - develops into the digestive tract
The embryo is now called a **Gastrula**, 3 cell layers are established
	- Ectoderm completely covers the gastrula except for the yolk plug (which forms the anus in frogs)
	- Blastocoel is gone and is replaced with the archenteron and endoderm
	- Mesoderm is fully formed between ecto and endoderm

Overview:
1. Zygote cleavage to blastula
2. Blastopore formation
3. Gastrulation starts - 3 layers of cells migrate
4. Gastrulation ends - completed, embryo is a form of a Gastrulas

### Organs
Organogenesis :: The formation of organs
Ectoderm infolding creates structures like the brain/spinal chord

**Slide 16a**
Neurulation :: First step in brain/spinal chord formation in vertebrates

Neural crest :: Migrate to form teeth, skull parts, peripheral nerves
Mesodermal cells adjacent to notochord :: Migrate, form somites (blocks of cells)
Somites? :: Mesoderm blocks for the purpose of giving 
How are somites arranged? :: Along the posterior and anterior axis,
Purpose of somites? :: To organise segmented structures in vertebrate embryos
Neural tube formation (17b) - starts flat, pinches down and releases a tube, top still flat - is the brain/spinal cord

Notochord in mesoderm -> backbone/spinal column
Coelom -> internal body cavity - this and other body parts are made of segmented units, basic chordate features
