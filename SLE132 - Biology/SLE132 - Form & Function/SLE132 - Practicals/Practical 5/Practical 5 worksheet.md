Moss drawing

Q1. How do the moss gametophyte and sporophyte stages obtain their
energy?
The gametophyte produces their energy through photosynthesis and cellular respiration. The sporophyte is primarily dependent on the gametophyte for energy and nutrition needs.

Question 2: Is the prominent part of the liverwort haploid or diploid? (1 mark)
It would be haploid. The prominent part of a liverwort is in the gametophyte stage, which is haploid.

Question 3: Are gemmae haploid or diploid? Are they produced by meiosis or mitosis?
(2 mark)
Gemmae are haploid as they are a part of the gametophyte generation. They are asexually reproduced and are hence produced mitotically as the DNA is duplicated, not unique.


Question 4: Examining the frond of a fern: if spores are produced on the fern plant, is it a sporophyte or a gametophyte? Is the plant haploid or diploid? (2 marks)
The plant would be a sporophyte as it is spore-producing and therefore diploid.


Question 5: Are the fern spores haploid or diploid? Are the spores produced by meiosis or mitosis? Where are the spores produced? (3 marks)
The spores of a fern are produced in the diploid sporangium organ. The spores themselves are haploid, being reduced through meiotic division.

Question 6: Describe two differences between a fern sporophyte and a moss sporophyte. (2 marks)
Moss sporophytes are long and easily observable stalks that protrude from the gametophyte whereas fern sporophytes are small and more hidden capsules. 
The sporangium in ferns are roughly spherical and have their lid open like a hinge while the moss sporangium are more elliptical and have their lid pop off



Both use water?

Question 7: How does the proteaceous flower structure differ from the other flower that you examined? Use the diagrams in the prac manual and list at least two differences in structure. (2 marks)

The other/half flower vs proteaceous flower

The proteaceous flower has their petals and sepals as a melded structure, the tepals, whereas the other flower had distinct petals and sepals. It also has the anther tucked into the perianth, being difficult to see, unlike the other flower which has clearly visible anthers.
