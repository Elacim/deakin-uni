### Homeostasis
Purpose? :: Best conditions for cells, enzymes, prevent dramatic fluctuations which coudl be damaging
What is it? :: Balancing
Internal vs external :: Envirnoment can be wildin' while internal can be fairly consistent

#### Feedback loops
**Negative feedback**
What is it? :: A counteracting reaction to an environmental change 
Body temperature an example of? :: Negative feedback
How does sweat cool you down? :: Sweat has heat -> evaporates, taking heat away
![[Body temp, negative feedback loop.png|200]]

Requirements? :: A receptor, a control centre, and an effector
Receptor purpose :: Detects abnormal conditions
Control centre purpose :: Takes receptor signals and tells the effector to react
Effector purpose :: The abnormal fixer

**Positive**
Not major in homeostasis
Positive: Push something in the same direction
Negative: Stabilise something


#### Coping

##### Regulators (B)
Mechanisms to stabilise internal environment in opposition to external conditions

##### Conformer (A)
No internal mechanisms to deal with external conditions.
A conformer, like crabs, will likely not survive in freshwater.


### Three ways of internal regulation

#### Thermoregulation
? :: Maintenance of body temperature to within an acceptable range
Purpose? :: Maintain optimal enzyme functionality
Temp. effects? :: Chemical reaction efficiency -> movementetc.
Temp. effect on species with differing optimal temps. :: Diff. animals have diff. optimal temps.

Heat loss vs. gain
In regards to heat, what is radiation? ::: Term for electromagnetic waves emitted by >0K objects
In regards to heat, what is evaporation? ::: Term for heat removal from liquid surface evaporating
In regards to heat, what is convection? ::: Term for heat transfer by air/liquid movement past a surface
In regards to heat, what is conduction? ::: Term for heat transfer by molecule-molecule contact

##### Ecto/endotherms
Are mammals endo or ectotherms? :: Endotherms
Are birds endo or ectotherms? :: Endotherms
Are most insects endo or ectotherms? :: Endotherms

Are most reptiles endo or ectotherms? :: Ectotherms
Are amphibians endo or ectotherms? :: Ectotherms
Are most fish endo or ectotherms? :: Ectotherms

###### Ectotherms
What is the heat source for ectotherms? :: The external environs
Why are fish ? :: Low metabolic rates mean low heat
Who? :: Few invertebrates, some fish, amphibians, most reptiles

###### Endotherms
What is the heat source for endotherms? :: Their own internal metabolism. Cell metabolism.
Who? :: Mammals, birds, some fish, few reptiles, many insects

###### Adaptations
[[Week 4a - Homeostasis.pdf#page=7]]
What is bathing an example of? :: Cooling through evaporation
What is kangaroos licking their chest/forearms (capillary locations) an example of? :: Cooling through evaporation
What is sweating an example of? :: Cooling through evaporation
What is panting an example of? :: Cooling through evaporation

What is basking an example of? :: A behavioural change
What is seeking shade an example of? :: A behavioural change
What is hibernation an example of? :: A behavioural change
What is pre-hibernation gorging an example of? :: A behavioural change
What is licking an example of? :: A behavioural change
What is migration to warmer/colder areas an example of? :: A behavioural change
What is nocturnal foraging an example of? :: A behavioural change
What is nesting an example of? :: A behavioural change
What is burrowing an example of? :: A behavioural change

What is fur, hair, and fat an example of? :: Changing heat exchange rates per the environment
What is insulation an example of? :: Changing heat exchange rates per the environment
What is vasoconstriction an example of? :: Changing heat exchange rates per the environment
What is vasodilation an example of? :: Changing heat exchange rates per the environment
What is counter-current heat exchange an example of? :: Changing heat exchange rates per the environment

What is shivering an example of? :: Altering metabolism to generate heat
What is non-shivering thermogenesis an example of? :: Altering metabolism to generate heat

What is non-shivering thermogenesis? :: The manipulation of Mitochondria processes to produce heat instead of ATP

Lots of flying insects warm up their body and flight muscles so they can take off well

#### Osmoregulation
Slide 7b

Many (but not all) marine animals are osmoconformers
Osmoregulators :: An animal that has differing solute concentrations to the environs
	All freshwater, many marine, all terrestrial animals
Energy needs to be expended to control/regulate water loss/gain

What types of marine animals are most likely to be osmoregulators? :: Marine vertebrates
Seawater is dehydrating to many marine vertebrates, and some invertebrates

Freshwater - gain water by osmosis and lose salts by diffusion

How is water gained in osmoregulators? :: Drinking, food sources, and as cell respiration by-products
How is water lost in osmoregulators? :: Respiration, evaporation, and waste removal
Water loss prevention :: Physical barriers (like skin), different behaviours (like nocturnal foraging only), and efficient excretory organs (kidneys)
