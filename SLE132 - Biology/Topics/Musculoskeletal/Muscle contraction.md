[Playlist on muscle contraction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIH8uOg8ddw&list=PLA_eIfVdLsxZBMNABupk3DGYYzwc5gfDx&index=4)

How does it occur? :: Actin filaments slide across myosin filaments to the centre of the sarcomere, shortening it
Does the length of the actin/myosin change during muscle contraction? :: No, they do not elongate and instead slide

#### Initial trigger
What [[Neuron types|neuron type]] controls muscle contraction? :: Motor neurons -> neuromuscular junction
What neurotransmitter controls muscle contraction? :: Acetylcholine (ACH)
What causes the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release $\ce{Ca^{2+}}$ ions? :: Acetylcholine by changing the SR permeability
Where are the $\ce{Ca^{2+}}$ ions released? :: Into muscle cell cytoplasm

#### Binding sites
See: [[Cross-bridge cycle]] for more information

What releases $\ce{Ca^{2+}}$ ions? :: The sarcoplasmic reticulum
What is bound to an at rest muscle? :: Regulatory proteins to the troponin complex
What binds to an activating muscle? :: $\ce{Ca^{2+}}$ ions bind to troponin and expose binding site
What is the effect of $\ce{Ca^{2+}}$ binding to troponin complexes? :: Tropomyosin is loosened and the myosin binding sites revealed
Effect of no troponin complex :: Random muscle spasming due to any passing $\ce{Ca^{2+}}$ being able to trigger a contraction
Shape of tropomyosin :: Helical

#### Strength
Motor unit :: A single motor nerve cell and all it's muscle fibres
What happens when a motor nerve cell fires? :: All the fibres in the motor unit contract

What does contraction strength depend on? :: The amount of activated motor units

How do nerve impulses affect muscle contraction strength? :: Two separate signals close together will add together, meaning a stronger response
