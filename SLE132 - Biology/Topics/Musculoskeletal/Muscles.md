Can muscles actively extend? :: No, they can only actively contract/shorten
How do muscles elongate/extend? :: By being pulled by another muscle
Name for muscle built for pulling another muscle :: Antagonistic muscle
Purpose of antagonistic muscle :: To allow another muscle to be extended, elongated, or relaxed. Think a pulley system - you can only feed it so far before you need to feed it back with the other side of the rope

What are the biceps and triceps an example of? :: Antagonistic muscles
How does muscle elongation occur? :: Passive stretching

Why are skeletal muscle nuclei located peripherally? :: So they don't get squished during movement

Where are insect muscles attached? :: To the inner exoskeleton
Joints of an insect are ... and ... to allow movement :: Thin and flexible

Intercalated discs :: Specialised junctions that enable electrical connection
Why are electric signals used in the heart? :: The heart is a vital organ that needs fast control

Slow contractions compared to skeletal with the ability to sustain contraction for extended periods
Found around internal organs

Found in both in and vertebrates
