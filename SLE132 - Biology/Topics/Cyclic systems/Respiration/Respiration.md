3 main process :: Gas exchange with environment, distribution of gases throughout the organism, and diffusion of gases

What affects the haemoglobin oxygen saturation? :: The partial pressure of oxygen
What is the purpose of respiration? :: Oxygen for cellular respiration and for removal of $CO_{2}$ coming from respiration


Characteristics of respiratory membranes :: Thin, well-ventilated, moist, and a high SA:V ratio
Challenges with maintaining respiratory membranes :: Keeping them moist and there must be structure keeping it spread out (preventing folding) 

Out-folding respiratory structures :: Skin and gills
In-folding :: Tracheae and lungs
