**Counter-current exchange (fish gills)**
What is counter-current exchange? ::: In $O_{2}$/$CO_{2}$ diffusion in fish, the blood is going one direction while water is going the other
How is counter-current exchange formed/maintained? :: The fish mouth constantly takes in water where it is pumped then allowed to flow over the gills in one direction
What is the primary benefit of counter-current exchange? :: From counter-current exchange, there should never be a $O_{2}:\text{oxygenated blood}$ equilibrium. This enables the fish to take $O_{2}$ from the flowing water and diffuse it with ease into the blood.
What is the result of a fish not having counter-current exchange? :: It would have less ability to utilise oxygen for body functions, notably disallowing it to move rapidly
It allows much more $O_{2}$ transfer - the concentrations are always different, whereas if they were parallel, an equilibrium would form and not as much $O_{2}$ would be transferred
