[Blood flow through the heart - Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBt5jZSWhMI)

Which direction do arteries go? :: Away from the heart
Which direction do veins go? :: Towards the heart

What do atria do? :: Collect the blood with it's thin walls, exclusively pumps to ventricles
What do ventricles do? :: Thick and muscular walls, strong contractions compared to atria
Which ventricle is thickest? :: The left ventricle as it pumps the blood out 
Left ventricle is significantly thicker than the right

Atriovencular is equivalent to :: Tri/bicuspid, which refers to valve attachment

Plural for atrium :: Atria
Plural for ventricle :: Ventricles

Structure of atria walls :: Thin
Structure of ventricle walls :: Thick and muscular

### Chambers
What is the purpose of atrium? :: To receive blood from relatively low pressure veins/arteries and for deposition into the right/left ventricles
What is the purpose of ventricles? :: To contract, pumping blood to the body 

What is the purpose of the right atrium? ::: It accepts deoxygenated blood from the merged two vena cava and pumps blood into the right ventricle
What is the purpose of the left atrium? ::: It accepts oxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins and pumps blood into the left ventricle

What is the purpose of the right ventricle? ::: It receives blood from the right atrium, then contracts, pumping blood into pulmonary arteries
What is the purpose of the left ventricle? ::: It receives blood from the left atrium, then contracts, pumping blood into the aorta

In mammals, which chambers of the heart contain oxygenated blood? ::: The left atrium and ventricle contain this blood
In mammals, which chambers of the heart contain deoxygenated blood? ::: The right atrium and ventricle contain this blood

Where does blood from the vena cavae dump to? :: The right atrium
Which atrium holds deoxygenated blood? :: The right atrium
Which ventricle holds deoxygenated blood? :: The right ventricle

Where does blood from the pulmonary vein dump to? :: The left atrium
Which atrium holds oxygenated blood? :: The left atrium
Which ventricle holds oxygenated blood? :: The left ventricle
