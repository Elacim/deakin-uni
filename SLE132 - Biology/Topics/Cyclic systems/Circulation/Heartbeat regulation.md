#flashcards/cyclic-systems/heart/heartbeat-regulation
Pacemaker cells purpose :: They keep the heartbeat in time and at regular intervals
Nervous messages :: from the brain, two sets of nerves (increase/decrease speed); used for example in exercise ("increase heart rate cause we're exercising")
- hormones
Two parts of the heart: Sinoatrial (SA) node - specialised region of cardiac muscle with pacemaker cells that establishes heart beat rate
Atrioventricular (AV) node - ventricular contraction

What is the sequence of a heartbeat?
?
1. Electrical signals are generated by pacemaker cells
2. Atria contract from signals
3. Atrioventricular node contracts 0.1 seconds after signal
4. Signal is carried to ventricle cardiac muscles by specialised muscle fibres
5. Ventricles contract


Cardiac output alterations:
activity levels (strenuous exercise can lead to a 5 fold increase)
hormones e.g. adrenalin
other chemicals e.g. caffeine
drugs e.g. beta-blockers
