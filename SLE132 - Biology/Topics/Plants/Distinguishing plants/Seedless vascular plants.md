Xylem: Water and mineral conducting cells
Phloem: distributes sugars, amino acids, and other organic products.
Allowances from this? :: Higher height, blotting out the sun for competitors

Bryophytes for first 100 million years of plants
Vascular plants diversified from 419-298.9mya

Flagellated sperm, primarily restricted to moist environments
Sporophytes are larger in seedless vascular plants
	Gametophytes are tiny plants growing on/below soil

Roots: specialized organs that anchor vascular plants
— Enable vascular plants to absorb water/nutrients from the soil
Leaves: specialised organs that increase the surface area of
vascular plants
— Capture more solar energy for photosynthesis

Lycophyta phylum
		Club mosses (have vascular tissue, not true moss)
		Spike mosses (' ')
		Quillworts
	Giants thrived in moist swamps; modern day are small and herbaceous


Monilophyta (Pterophyta)
		Ferns (most diverse w/ 12,000 species)
		Horsetails (mya were diverse; modern: only Equisetum genus)
		Whisk ferns and related friends (no true roots)
	Most diverse in tropics; thrive in temperate forests

	Are the 'electrical' nerves still using neurotransmitters?
	Or are the neurotransmitters only for nerve-nerve communication?
	What does nerve pain/constant pain look like on a graph level?
		Is it like the tetanus graph?


How is pollen a big deal in terms of spreading? :: It does not need liquid for fertilisation




Nearly all seedless plants are homosporous, all seed plants
are heterosporous (produce two types of spores)
Megasporangia outcome :: Megaspores which become female gametophytes
Microsporangia outcome :: Microspores which become male gametophytes
What do microspores produce? :: Pollen grains which house male gametophytes
Spores are the sperm/eggs
