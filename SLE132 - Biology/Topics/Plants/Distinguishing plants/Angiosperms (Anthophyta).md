All Anthophyta (flowering plants) has all angiosperms
What is a cotyledon? :: A sprouting leaf in an embryo

Flowers and fruit
Most widespread and diverse being specialised for sexual reproduction

What are the 3Fs? :: Flowers, fruit, and double fertilisation
What three characteristics do all angiosperms have? :: Flowers, fruit, and double fertilisation
What are the main groups of angiosperms? :: Monocotyledons (65 species) and dicotyledons (175k species)

Monocots and dicots differ in the external (morphology) and internal (anatomy) structure of a plant
#### Monocots and eudicots

| Feature        | Monocots               | Eudicots                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Embryo         | One cotyledon          | Two cotyledons            |
| Leaf venation  | Parallel leaves        | Netlike veins             |
| Stems          | Scattered              | Ring                      |
| Roots          | No taproot             | Taproot present           |
| Pollen         | Grain with one opening | Grain with three openings |
| Flowers organs | Multiples of 3         | Multiples of 4/5          |

Anthophyta (flowering plants) has all angiosperms
Monocots and dicots differ in the external (morphology) and internal (anatomy) structure of a plant
##### Monocots
How many species are in monocots? :: Roughly 65,0000 species
What are monocots? :: It has one cotyledon, known as seed leaf`
Percent of angiosperms that are monocots? :: Roughly 25% ($\frac{1}{4}$)
Grasses are generally monocots

What species are monocots? :: Grasses, Lilies, Irises, Orchids, Palms, Sugar Cane and Wheat Plants

##### Eudicots/dicots
How many species are in eudicots? :: Roughly 175,0000 species
What are eudicots? :: Angiosperms with two cotyledons, or `seed leaves`
Percent of angiosperms that are eudicots? :: Roughly 75% ($\frac{3}{4}$)

What species are dicots? :: Shrubs, Trees (not conifers), Herbs
