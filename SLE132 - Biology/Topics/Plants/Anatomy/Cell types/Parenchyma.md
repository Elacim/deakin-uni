**Parenchyma** - Unspecialised and easily adaptable living cells that perform many critical functions of plants, including photosynthesis, and combine, forming a tissue

How can parenchyma be remembered? :: *Para-enchyma*, meaning *beside-tissue*. It can be thought of as a filler tissue.

Are parenchyma specialised? :: No, they are relatively generic

What purpose do parenchyma have?
?
- To perform photosynthesis (metabolic processes)
- Storage of misc. organic products
- Secretion

Where are parenchyma found?
?
In soft tissues like:
- The pith/cortex
- Stem/root parts

How are parenchyma grouped? :: They are closely packed together with small amounts of intracellular space

Is the vacuole prominent in parenchyma? :: Yes, the central vacuole is large

Are the primary walls thin, thick, or in-between? :: They are thin and flexible

What do some parenchyma cells found in roots and stems contain? ::  [[Plastids#Amyloplasts|Amyloplasts]], used for starch storage
