# parenchyma, and sclerenchyma cells

How does the xylem differ from the phloem? :: The xylem transports only water, is dead at maturity, and has different cells

What is phloem sap? :: Sugary solution that can move freely between cells (Inorganic ions, amino acids, hormones, sucrose)


What do phloem transport? :: Phloem sap (sugars in solution)
How does a phloem transport in regards to sugar sources/sinks? :: They always transport from a sugar source to a sugar sink 
Which way does the phloem flow? :: It is multidirectional

What is the general structure of a phloem?
?
A series of sieve-tube elements (cells) connected by sieve-plates
A companion cell is adjacent to each element that provides nutrients for the element.
There are also supporting fibres.

Are phloem cells alive? :: Yes, they are alive at maturity

What part of the phloem transports the nutrients? :: The sieve tubes

From what do companion cells and sieve-tube elements originate from? :: The same mother cell, meaning the cells and elements are sistersz

##### Companion cells
What type of cell are companion cells? :: [[Parenchyma]]
How does a companion cell compare to a regular plant cell in regards to organelles? :: Much the same except for with more ribosomes and mitochondria 

What is the purpose of the companion cell? :: To provide the sieve-tube cells with resources they can not produce due to their lacking protoplasm
What do companion cells share with sieve-tube cells? :: Proteins and energy
How do companion cells share their resources? :: Through many plasmodesmata

What do companion cells in some plant species' leaves do for the sieve-tube elements? :: They load sugars into the sap

What are companion cells in regards to sap transport? :: They are known as non-conducting cells

#### Sieve-tubes
**NOTE: Functionality of sieve-tube elements = (sieve-tube cells = sieve-tube members)**
How are sieve-tube members different to sieve-tube cells? :: In function, identical. The difference is in members being only found in angiosperms and cells being only in gymnosperms. Elements refers to either/or.

What plants are sieve-tube cells found in? :: Gymnosperms (non-flowering vascular plants)
What plants are sieve-tube members found in? :: Angiosperms (flowering vascular plants)

What are sieve tubes comprised of? :: Sieve-tube elements/members/cells
What separates sieve tube elements? :: Sieve plates
What is the structure of a sieve plate? :: A roughly cylindrical plate with perforations
Why are sieve-plates in-between sieve-tube elements? :: The pores within sieve plates can alter their size for better/restricted flow
What type of cell are sieve-tube cells? :: [[Parenchyma]]

###### Structure
What is the purpose of sieve-tube elements lacking most of their protoplasm? :: It allows maximum throughput of sap

What is special about the structure of sieve-tube elements? :: They lack most of their protoplasm - no nucleus, ribosomes, distinct vacuole, and cytoskeleton components
Do sieve-tube elements have a nucleus? :: No.
Do sieve-tube elements have ribosomes? :: No.
Do sieve-tube elements have a vacuole? :: Yes, but not a distinct one
Do sieve-tube elements have a cytoskeleton? :: Yes, but it is lacking elements
