How does the phloem differ from the xylem? :: The phloem transports nutrients (in fluid), is alive at maturity, and has differing cells in play

Etymology of xylem :: Xylon meaning 'Wood'
What are the contents that the xylem transports? :: Exclusively water
Is the xylem dead or alive at maturity? :: It is dead at maturity

The xylem is a subset of what tissue type? :: Complex vascular tissue
What basic cell types does the xylem contain? :: [[Sclerenchyma]] and [[Parenchyma]] 
What cells transport the xylem contents? :: The tracheids and vessel elements 

What direction(s) does the xylem contents flow? :: One direction, from roots to the leaves and stems (upwards)

## Tracheids and vessel elements

Why would a tracheid be used if vessel elements are more efficient transporters? :: Tracheids have greater manoeuvrability due to their sequential cells, allowing twists and turns

What connects roots and leaves? :: A series of tracheid cells

How does water flow in tracheids? :: Non-continuously as connections need to be passed from cell-cell
How does water flow in vessel elements? :: Continuously as it is a hollow tube

What is a secondary wall? :: A plant cell has two walls, a primary and secondary. The secondary is produced inside the cell after the primary (outer) has finished developing
What are pits? :: Thin sections of a plant cell's secondary wall that allow water movement
### Tracheids
What purpose do tracheids have? :: To provide structural support and to transport water through their pits
Are tracheids living? :: At maturity, tracheid cells are not living

In what plants are tracheids found? :: All vascular plants
In plant group(s) are tracheids and not vessel members present? :: Many non-flowering plants; some non-flowering plants may have both cell types

What is the wood of gymnosperms primarily comprised of? :: Tracheids
###### Structure
What is the shape of a tracheid (the full structure)? :: It is a moderately tapered, small radius cylinder with thin walls 
What is the approximate diameter of a tracheid? :: $\approx 10 \mu \text{m}$
How are tracheids connected? :: Through their pits and side-by-side and stacked on top of each other
What is the structure of mature tracheid cell? :: It is only a cell wall with no protoplast (inner cell contents)


### Vessel elements
In what plants are vessel elements found? :: Most angiosperms, some gymnos, and other seed-bearing plants
What is the shape of a vessel element? :: It is a lightly tapered, wide radius cylinder with thin walls
What is the approximate diameter of a vessel element? :: Approximately $40 \mu \text{m}$

What is a sequence of aligned vessel elements known as? :: Vessels

What permits water flow between vessel elements? :: Perforated plates
