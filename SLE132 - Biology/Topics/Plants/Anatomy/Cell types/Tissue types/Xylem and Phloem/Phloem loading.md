Symplastic loading :: Mesophyll to companion cell/sieve tube sucrose transport via plasmodesmata
Apoplastic loading :: Apoplast to companion cell/sieve tube/symplast

What are the purpose of these ingrowths on companion cells? ![[Phloem loading - Companion cell ingrowths.png|50]] :: They increase SA:V

How is sucrose from the apoplast delivered to the symplast? :: Through a cotransporter protein by coupling protons from a proton pump with sucrose
