[Sclerenchyma - Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/sclerenchyma)

**Sclerenchyma** - Non-living cells with thick walls that can be fibres or varying box-like shapes that provide rigid support for plant structures, forming a tissue

What is the primary purpose of sclerenchyma? :: For non-flexible structural support

How can sclerenchyma be remembered? :: *Sclero-enchyma*, meaning *hard-tissue*


- Cannot elongate when mature
- Mature only in non-growing regions
	- Mature stems/bark

[[Plant terms#Lignin]]

What are the two main sclerenchyma cell types? :: Sclereids/stone cells and fibres 
#### Sclereids
Alternate name for sclereids :: Stone cells
What is the shape of a sclereid? :: Roughly box-shaped, though this is highly variable

Is the sclereid cell wall thin, medium, or thick? :: Thick (mostly the secondary)

Where are stone cells primarily found in plants? :: The pith and cortex, and the xylem and phloem

- responsible for nutshell/seed hardness
	- apple/pear hard bits

#### Fibres
What is the shape of a fibre? :: Long, slender, and with tapered ends
How are fibres generally grouped? :: They are densely packed, interweaving, and typically grouped together

Where are fibres primarily found in plants? :: They can be found almost anywhere in plants, such as the roots, stems, bark, wood, or the vascular bundles in leaves

For human use, what are fibres used for? :: Weaving things (hemp fibres for rope, flax for textiles, etc.) with dense fibres
