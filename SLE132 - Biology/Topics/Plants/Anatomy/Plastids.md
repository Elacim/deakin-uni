A plastid is a membrane-bound organelle

Chloroplasts: typically green plastids used for photosynthesis.
	Etioplasts are the precursors of chloroplasts
Chromoplasts: coloured plastids for pigment synthesis and storage
Gerontoplasts: control the dismantling of the photosynthetic apparatus during plant senescence

#### Leucoplasts
Leucoplasts :: colourless plastids for monoterpene synthesis; leucoplasts sometimes differentiate into more specialized plastids:

Elaioplasts :: Used for storing fat
Proteinoplasts :: Used for storing and modifying protein
Tannosomes :: Used for synthesizing and producing tannins and polyphenols
###### Amyloplasts
Amyloplasts :: Used for storing starch and gravity-detection (accounting for geotropism)
