![[Photosystem II and I diagram.png]]

What is one of the strongest known biological oxidisers that is also used in the light reactions? :: $P680^{+}$
What is the primary electron acceptor in the photosystem II? :: Pheophytin

How is $H_{2}O$ used in photosystem II? :: It is split by enzymes and its electrons given to $P680^{+}$
At what stage is $H_{2}O$ used in the light reactions? :: In photosystem II when $e^{-}$ are passed over to $P680^{+}$ 

What receives a photon to kickstart the light reactions? :: A pigment molecule
Does a pigment molecule transfer it's $e^{-}$ directly to the primary acceptor? :: No, it is first transferred to the primary donor proteins
