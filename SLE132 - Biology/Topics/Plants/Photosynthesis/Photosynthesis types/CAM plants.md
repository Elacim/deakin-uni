Name :: Crassulacean acid metabolism, coming from the plant family Crassulaceae where CAM was first found

Instead of separating the light-dependent reactions and the use of $\ce{CO2}$ in the Calvin cycle in space, CAM plants separate these processes in time. At night, CAM plants open their stomata, allowing ‍$\ce{CO2}$ to diffuse into the leaves. This ‍$\ce{CO2}$ is fixed into oxaloacetate by PEP carboxylase (the same step used by ‍
C4 plants), then converted to malate or another type of organic acid
‍
The organic acid is stored inside vacuoles until the next day. In the daylight, the CAM plants do not open their stomata, but they can still photosynthesize. That's because the organic acids are transported out of the vacuole and broken down to release $\ce{CO2}$, which enters the Calvin cycle. This controlled release maintains a high concentration of ‍$\ce{CO2}$ around rubisco‍.
