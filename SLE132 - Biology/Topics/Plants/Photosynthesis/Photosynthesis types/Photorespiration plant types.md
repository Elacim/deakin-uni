| Type | $\ce{CO2}$ fixation and Calvin cycle | Stomata open | Adapted to environs |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| C3 | No separation | Day | Cool and wet |
| C4 | Mesophyll then bundle-sheathe cells (space) | Day | Hot and sunny |
| CAM | Night and day (time) | Night | Very hot and arid |

The majority of plants are C3 ($C_{3}$) plants, which have no special features to combat photorespiration.

$C_{4}$ plants minimize photorespiration by separating initial $\ce{CO2}$ fixation and the Calvin cycle in space, performing these steps in different cell types.

**Crassulacean acid metabolism** (**CAM**) plants minimize photorespiration and save water by separating these steps in time, between night and day.
