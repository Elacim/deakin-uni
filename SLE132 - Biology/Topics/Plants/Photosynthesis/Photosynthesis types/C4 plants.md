In these plants, the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle are physically separated, with the light-dependent reactions occurring in the mesophyll cells (spongy tissue in the middle of the leaf) and the Calvin cycle occurring in special cells around the leaf veins. These cells are called **bundle-sheath** cells.

To see how this division helps, let's look at an example of photosynthesis in action. First, atmospheric $\ce{CO2}$ is fixed in the mesophyll cells to form a simple, 4-carbon organic acid (oxaloacetate). This step is carried out by a non-rubisco enzyme, PEP carboxylase, that has no tendency to bind $\ce{O2}$. Oxaloacetate is then converted to a similar molecule, malate, that can be transported in to the bundle-sheath cells. Inside the bundle sheath, malate breaks down, releasing a molecule of ‍ $\ce{CO2}$. The $\ce{CO2}$ is then fixed by rubisco and made into sugars via the Calvin cycle, exactly as in [[C3 plants|C3]] photosynthesis.
