Kingdom :: Blue-green algae are with bacteria while other groups are with protists
What makes algae not a plant? :: Embryos are not held within the parental tissue; this follows the embryophyte definition of plants

Algae reproduction :: In most algae, parents shed female and male gametes and use water-based fertilisation
Reproductive cells occur in unicellular or multicellular organs, in which every cell is fertile
In some unicellular species, the organism itself is the gamete for sexual reproduction

Light and temperature are important for algae.
Synergistic effects occur in species from environmental effects
