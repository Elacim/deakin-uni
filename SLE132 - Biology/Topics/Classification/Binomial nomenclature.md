1.5 million species of animals (less than 20% of all *living* species)
Formal naming:
	- better communication between scientists speaking any language
	- Derived from Carl Linnaeus in 1700s
	- e.g. A dog's scientific name is *Canis familiaris*

Naming format:\<Genus> \<species>
	-Genus is capitalised, species is all lowercase 
	-Italicise digitally, underline in handwriting
	-Naming is latinised
	-If species is unknown, then write '*sp.*' after genus
	-If a sub-species, simply add it on

Plant names have the authors who found the plant listed after the scientific name - e.g. *Lomandra filiformis* R. Br  
	(Robert Brown) 

**Importance**
- Set of conventions as a universal language for communication
- Common names are misleading
