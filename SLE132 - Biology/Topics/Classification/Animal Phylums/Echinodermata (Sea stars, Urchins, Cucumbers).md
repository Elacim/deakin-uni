What is the Water Vascular System? :: A series of hydraulic canals the lead and organically split into the Echinoderm feet



### Anatomy and Systems
###### Skeleton
What type of skeleton do Echinoderms have? :: Endoskeletons comprised of calcium carbonate ($CaCO_{3}$)
###### Protection
Do Echinoderms have any form of protection? :: Yes, they may have small spines littered on their skin to deter predators
###### Nervous system
Where is a sea star's nerve ring located? :: Around it's hole, known as the central disc
Is a nerve ring all the nerves in a sea star? :: No, the ring also has nerve cords branching out into each arm

###### Circulatory system
What is the circulatory force within Echinoderms? :: The water vascular system
What is the name for the vessels in which the water vascular system flows? :: Canals, which altogether comprise the haemal system
What the haemal system? :: A compilation of vessels both for exchanging gases with the environment and for transporting fluids throughout the organism's body
How do Echinoderms exchange gases internally and externally? :: Using their water vascular system
How does water enter and exit Echinoderms? :: Through a soft, porous surface known as the madreporite
What is the purpose of the madreporite? :: To filter and control the entrance in and exiting out of seawater within an Echinoderm 
###### Respiration
How do Echinoderms respirate? :: Through gills within their skin, known fully as skin gills
What is another name for skin gills? :: Papulae 
What are papulae? :: As another name for skin gills, papulae exchange gases with the environment, allowing the Echinoderm to breathe
###### Reproduction
How do Echinoderms reproduce? :: Females/males release gametes into the water and hope for the best
Are Echinoderms hermaphrodites? :: They can be.  

###### Digestion/Egestion
Where and how do Echinoderms digest their food? :: In their two stomachs and by using digestive enzymes cooked up in stomach-external digestive glands
How is excretion handled? :: Through a digestive tract and out their anus located on their top side

Do Echinoderms have a mouth AND an anus? :: Yes, the mouth is located anteriorly (on the bottom) and anus located dorsally (on the top)

###### Movement
How do Echinoderms move? :: Using the water vascular system canals allows the contraction and extension of their feet 

What is the anatomy of a sea star's tube feet? :: It consists of a bulbous ampulla connected to a long tube known as the podium (the 'foot')
What are the two purposes of the ampulla? :: One is to suck in and store water to retract from a surface and the other is to squeeze out water to attach to a surface
What are the two purposes of the podium? :: One is to expand from the ampulla water store, come into contact with a surface, and release adhesive chemicals, and the other is to contract it's muscles (letting water be stored in the ampulla again) and to release un-adhesive chemicals 

What leaves sea star footprints? :: Adhesive and un-adhesive chemicals that come from attaching to then detaching from a surface
