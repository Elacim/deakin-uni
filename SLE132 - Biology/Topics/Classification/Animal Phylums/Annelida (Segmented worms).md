What are the main characteristics of Sedentarians? :: Reduced mobility, burrowers/tube-livers
What are the main species found within the Sedentarians class? :: Leeches and Earthworms

What is the skeleton type of a Annelida? :: Hydrostatic, as their body is filled with coelomic fluid
### Anatomy

**Nerves**
What are Annelida nervous systems like? :: A ring of nerves around the anterior and one set of paired nerves that go across their whole body

What do Annelid nerves, digestive tracts, and blood vessels have in common? :: They all travel longitudinal along the body

Do Annelids have blood? :: Yes, they have blood vessels too that respirate through moistened pores on their skin. The blood even contains haemoglobin.

**Misc.**

What is the purpose of the Clitellum? :: To store eggs and/or sperm 

**Digestion**
How do Annelids ingest? :: They ingest through their mouth, located anteriorly
How do Annelids egest? :: They egest through their posterior anus
How do Annelids digest food? :: Through grinding using rocks eaten to be used within the gizzard

**Waste removal**
How do Annelids remove waste from their cells? :: Through pores in paired metanephridia tubes which are found in each segment
What is the purpose of metanephridia tubes? :: To remove waste from the blood and coelomic fluid
What is the name *and* shape of metanephridia openings? :: They are known as *nephrostomes* and are shaped like hairy funnels
What are nephrostomes lined with? :: Cilia


**Movement**
How do Annelids burrow? :: Eating the soil and by using chaetae found on each segment for traction
