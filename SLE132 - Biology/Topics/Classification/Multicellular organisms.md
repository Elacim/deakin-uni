#flashcards/classification/multicellular

How can multicellular organisms be large? :: 

Advantages of being multicellular :: Specialised cells (tissues), a larger size can be maintained (SA:V limitations are overcome), a big size prevents predation and allows increased defence, the ability to obtain food/energy, and the ability to adapt and maximise opportunity in differing environmental conditions

Disadvantages of being multicellular :: Ridding waste, gaining access to nutrients/oxygen, a more complex structure is needed

Larger and more complex animals and therefore need systems in place to transport substances in/away from cells not interfacing with the environment - PAGE 16a, b for diagram

Purpose of a high SA:V ratio :: To minimise transportation costs and to maximise diffusion potential for waste and resources

#### Animals
Are animals hetero or autotrophs? :: Animals are vastly heterotrophs, eating autotrophs; rare exceptions are mixotrophs which do both
Are animals ever prokaryotic? :: No, they are all eukaryotic
What are tissues in animals held together by? :: Collagen
How do animals reproduce? :: Predominately sexually and rarely asexually
Are all animals mobile? :: They generally are mobile, though some are sessile, or have limited movement
