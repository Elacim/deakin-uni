What is the purpose of neurons? :: To transmit nerve impulses

![[Neuron - typical neuron.jpg|300]]

What are the basic components of neurons? :: Dendrites, a cell body, Schwann cells, axons, and axon terminals


Why can neurons transmit nerve impulses? :: They have $\ce{Na+ \& K+}$ gated channels which permit the membrane potential to shift

What causes 

Synaptic knobs

Glial cells surround neurons, from 10-50x the amount of neurons
Some nourish, other produce myelin (Schwann cells)
