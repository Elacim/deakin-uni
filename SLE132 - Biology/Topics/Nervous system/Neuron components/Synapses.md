? :: The point at which the signal arriving from the axon of one synapse/neuron flows to another synapse/neuron

Components :: The pre-synapse, synaptic gap, and the post-synapse

Is it only 1 synapse per axon? :: No, there can be many synapses/axon

###### Pre-synapse
Other name for the pre-synapse? :: The axon terminal
What part of the neuron contains the pre-synapse? :: The axon terminal
Components :: Semipermeable membrane and neurotransmitters on an axon terminal
Pre-synaptic terminal purpose :: Neurotransmitter producer and releaser 

###### Post-synapse
What part of the neuron contains the post-synapse? :: The dendrite
Components :: Semipermeable membrane and receptors on a dendrite
Post-synaptic terminal :: Neurotransmitter receiver; signal propagator


### Action potential transmission
1. Action potential arrives at the synaptic knob
2. The depolarising membrane allows gated channels to let $Ca^{2+}$ enter the knob
3. High $Ca^{2+}$ concentration causes synaptic vesicles to fuse with the membrane
	1. Causing neurotransmitters to be released into synaptic cleft
4. Neurotransmitters move and bind to receptors found on the post-synaptic cell
5. Neurotransmitter binding causes $\ce{Na^{+}}$ gated channels and produces an action potential
6. Neurotransmitters are broken down and recycled by an enzyme
