Etymology :: The Latin 'saltus' meaning 'jump, to leap'
Other name for saltatory conduction :: Jumping conduction

What is saltatory conduction?
?
As the signal moves, the axon segment (membrane) it just travelled through becomes depolarised, preventing the signal from going backwards. 
The nodes of Ranvier and the heavily insulated myelin sheathe allow the electric signal to 'jump' over the myelin sheathe, allowing significant time saves in signal transmission.
