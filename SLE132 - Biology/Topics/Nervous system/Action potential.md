1. Resting state where internal side of the membrane is negative
2. Start of depolarisation following stimuli allowing $\ce{Na+}$ inflow, if stimuli is strong enough, continue depolarisation, otherwise only do step 4
3. Near complete membrane depolarisation, causing internal membrane to be positive
4. Falling phase where sodium channels stop inflowing $\ce{Na+}$ and potassium channels open, allowing $\ce{K+}$ to flow out; inner membrane is negative again now
5. Undershoot where sodium channels are closed, some potassium channels remain open

mV/membrane potential/volts

What causes membrane potential? :: Negatively charge proteins (internal), $\ce{Na+}$ on the outside, and $\ce{K+}$ ions on the inside

Aside from other neurons, what is the trigger of an action potential? :: A stimulus
How do action potentials travel? :: Through continuous membrane depolarisation by opening $\ce{Na+}$ gated channels
What is membrane depolarisation? :: The flipping of the cell's internal polarity from negative to positive, meaning externally, it's positive to negative


What is the purpose of the over/undershoot stage of an action potential? :: To prevent immediate restimulation (known as a refractory period) by hyperpolarisation

What does it mean when an action potential is described as an 'all or none' effect? :: To trigger, it needs the threshold potential to be overcome

Do action potentials require ATP to propagate? :: No
Can a membrane have a few action potentials then stop? :: No, maybe one, but it is an all-or-none approach
Per stimuli, will a neuron alter it's action potential's graph shape, magnitude, or direction? :: No, a neuron is always the same though different neurons can have differing values

#### Membrane potentials (mV)
![[Action potential - membrane potentials.png|300]]
Resting potential restoration :: Opening of potassium ion gated channels and closing of sodium ion gated channels, resetting the membrane to the resting mV

Charge of a resting potential in a neuron :: -70mV
What is the threshold potential (in mV)? :: -55mV
High point of action potential mV :: +30 to +50mV
What is hyperpolarisation mV? :: -90mV


What does a membrane potential greater than 0mV mean? :: The membrane is more and more polarised
Effect of a great stimulus on sodium ion channels :: More channels are  opened

Threshold potential :: The amount of energy (depolarisation) needed to generate a continuing and rapid change in membrane potential that propagates along the axon in one direction
Why a threshold for action potentials? :: It prevents misfiring and it also is the gate for the right amount of energy reaching the next axon
