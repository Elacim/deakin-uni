What phylum has similar reproduction to Chordates? :: [[Echinodermata (Sea stars, Urchins, Cucumbers)]]

What are the primary differences between Echinoderm and Mammalian fertilisation? :: External vs. usually internal, fast and slow block vs only slow block, sperm nucleus only vs whole sperm, 2n vs n+n, and 90 minute fertilisation time vs 0.5-1.5 days

Is Echinoderm fertilisation internal or external? :: External - the gametes are released into the ocean
True or False: In Mammals, there is a slow-block mechanism with cortical granules and a fast-block with membrane depolarisation :: False. Mammals only have a slow-block mechanism whereas Echinoderms have a slow and fast-block
When do Echinoderms have a diploid zygote? :: As soon as the DNA meshes together
When do Mammals have a diploid zygote? :: Just before the first mitotic division

Unlike in Echinoderms, there is no fast-block system in Mammalian fertilisation, and in mammals, the whole sperm is taken into to egg whereas in Echinoderms, only the nucleus is, and the time taken (90 mins vs. 0.5-1.5 days)

How long does Mammalian fertilisation take? :: 12-36 hours, or 0.5-1.5 days
How long does Echinoderm fertilisation take? :: Roughly 90 minutes, or, 1.5 hours

How long does it take for the entire mammalian fertilisation process to occur after initial sperm-egg contact? :: Between 12-36 hours (0.5-1.5 days)
At what stage is the egg and sperm DNA combined? :: Just before the first mitotic division 
When do the embryo cells become diploid? :: After the initial division where the result is two daughter cells

## Cortical reaction
What are the three key organelles in the cortical reaction? :: The smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum, cortical granules, and the cell membrane

Where are cortical granules located? :: The egg cortex, or, as close to the edge of the inner cell membrane as possible
When do cortical granules undergo exocytosis? :: After receiving signalling $Ca^{2+}$ ions from the endoplasmic reticulum

At what location do $Ca^{2+}$ ions originate from? :: The endoplasmic reticulum releases $Ca^{2+}$ ions at the location of the sperm nucleus entry point
What is the definition of 'cortical' and how does it apply to the 'cortical reaction'? :: It refers to the outer part of a body component, in the case of the cortical reaction, it refers to the cell membrane of the egg
What is the cortical reaction in overview? :: Triggered by sperm-egg fusion, it is a reaction where calcium ions $(Ca^{2+})$ is released by the [[Endoplasmic Reticulum]], causing cortical granules to release their contents, hardening the membrane for blocking further sperm
What is the purpose of the cortical reaction? :: It is a slow-block to polyspermy and is used as a more permanent solution compared to fast-blocks

What is the purpose of the cortical reaction separating the egg membrane? :: 

What are the functions of a given cortical granule contents? :: To separate the membrane, generate an osmotic gradient, and to harden the vitelline layer

What other fertilisation-related reaction has a similar function to the cortical reaction? :: The acrosomal reaction in sperm - the main purpose of that being to break down the egg barrier for 


Cortical granules fuse w/ membrane, releasing contents between vitelline space and egg membrane
	Separates membranes
	Osmotic gradient
	Enzymes harden the vitelline layer, creating a physical barrier
	Known as the slow block to polyspermy (more permanent)
- sperm tail sticks out
- very quick fertilisation time, fusing is fast
- The fertilisation envelope is present during blastula stages
# Echinoderm
Process of fertilisation :: Contact, acrosomal reaction, actin filaments, fusion, nucleus entry, cortical reaction
Fertilisation - step 1: Contact :: Jelly coating is contacted
Fertilisation - step 2: Acrosomal reaction :: Sperm releases enzymes to form holes in the jelly
Fertilisation - step 3: Actin filaments :: Grow from sperm and bind to receptors on the egg
Fertilisation - step 4: Nucleus entry :: The nucleus is entered 
Fertilisation - step 5: Fusion :: Sperm and egg membranes fuse and the membrane potential shifts (depolarises)

What is the purpose of membrane depolarisation? :: To prevent additional sperm-egg fusion (fast block to polyspermy)
What is fast block to polyspermy triggered by? :: The depolarisation of the egg membrane
What is the purpose of fast/slow blocks to polyspermy? :: To limit the chance of extra sets of chromosomes within a maturing zygote which will always lead to either an unfeasible or severely malformed embryo 



# Mammals
What is the ECM of the egg? :: The zona pellucida
What is the zona pellucida? :: A thick ECM encasing an egg
Where is the zona pellucida located? :: Around the egg
What is the purpose of the zona pellucida? :: To be a sperm receptacle

What is the layer surrounding an egg? :: A multi-cell thick layer of follicle cells

Why is mitochondrial DNA only passed on maternally? :: When the sperm enters the egg, the mitochondria-rich tail is used for parts and therefore only the egg mitochondrial DNA is passed on
