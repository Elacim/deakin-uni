What are the general characteristics of molecules with non-polar covalent bond? ::  They tend to be gas at room temperature. Examples: $CS_{2}$, $PH_{3}$, or $H_{2}$ 
What are the general characteristics of molecules with polar covalent bond? ::  They are a solid/liquid/gas at room temperature. Examples: $HF$ or $H_{2}O$
What are the general characteristics of molecules with an ionic bond? :: They tend to be solids at room temperature, are held together purely by attraction forces. Bonds are usually between a non-metal and metal, with the non-metal ripping electrons from the metal. Examples: $Na^{+}Cl^{-}$ or $NaF$

When writing chemical formulas, which two elements have priority and why? :: Carbon is first, hydrogen second, and other elements in alphabetical order. This is because the majority of complex molecular compounds are carbon-containing compounds (e.g. $C_{4}H_{10}$, $C_4H_9BrO$)

What atoms can make a Hydrogen bond? :: 
When you say 'electron pair', what does that mean ("There must be a small, highly electronegative atom with an electron pair that can interact with the $H^{+}$ atom"?
-> Nitrogen, fluorine, and oxygen
-> Smaller size allows hydrogen bonds

Covalent bonds do not break when a substance changes from one phase to another. Only forces holding separate molecules together (intermolecular forces) need to be overcome, not forces holding the atoms together in the molecule itself (intramolecular forces). In chloromethane ($CH_{3}Cl$), dispersion forces and dipole-dipole forces must be overcome.

Intra > inter
Strongest
Intra: Covalent (vary in strength, conditions dependent)
Intra/Inter: Ionic (electrostatic, is charged - not a covalent, strong because hard to rid - and +)
Inter/Intra: Ion-dipole: Water ripping $NaCl$
Inter: Hydrogen
Inter: Dipolar
Inter: Dispersion (ramps up with size)
Least strongest

How do you translate a structural formula to a chemical?
?
- Count all atoms of each type
- If no carbons:
	- Except $H$, elements further left on the periodic table appear first
	- $H$ is always written last except when with elements found in groups 16 or 17
	- If elements are from the same group, the heaviest element (i.e. lower down on the periodic table) appears firs
	Metal like thing first then non-metal thing second

How do atoms/molecules in precipitation reactions pair up (in terms of $A,B,C, \& D$)? :: $AB + CD \rightarrow AD + BC$

Determinant of solubility (week 6)

Why don't ionic solids conduct electricity as a solid? :: 
Metallic :: One or more types of metal combined

When you say 'molar enthalpy of fusion'
Molar enthalpy meaning? 
'of fusion/freezing'
'of vaporisation' same as condensation (same but different sign)
'of sublimation'


What is the boiling point?
The temperature at which the average kinetic energy of molecular motion balances the attractive energy of intermolecular attractions
	- balances -> the boiling point is never (traditionally) exceeded. Anything past this leads to evaporation (boiling)
	- Once the boiling point is reached, the molecules can move so much so that they break free of the intermolecular interactions

Why do liquids prefer a smaller surface area? 
Why does a higher polarity lead to a higher surface tension?

You have been provided with a $2.12 \times 10^{-2} L$  sample of lithium hydroxide ($LiOH$) of unknown concentration. You perform a titration with $2.19 M$ nitric acid ($HNO_{3}$), and find that 24.6 mL are required to reach the equivalence point (as determined using a coloured indicator). What is the concentration of the lithium hydroxide solution in mol $L^{-1}$?
$C_{1}V_{1}=V_{2}C_{2}$
$x \times 0.0212L = 2.19M \times 0.0246L$
$x = 2.5412264151 = 2.54$

You perform a titration with 1.48 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and find that 3.81 x 10-2 L are required to reach the equivalence point (as determined using a coloured indicator). What is the concentration of the hydrochloric acid?
$C_{1}V_{1}=C_{2}V_{2}$
$x \times 0.0429L = 1.48M \times 0.0381L$

A $1.71 L$ solution containing $1.75$ mol $L^{-1}$ hydrochloric acid (HCl) has been left on your bench. How many moles of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) are needed to neutralise the acid?
$C=\frac{n}{V} \rightarrow n=CV$
$n=1.75molL \times 1.71L = 2.9925 = 2.99$ mol $HCl$
Therefore, 2.99mol of $NaOH$ is needed to fully neutralise the $HCl$

A 2.01 L solution containing 1.77 mol L-1 potassium hydroxide (KOH) has been left on your bench. How many moles of nitric acid (HNO3) are needed to neutralise solution?
$n=CV$
$1.77M \times 2.01L = 3.5577 = 3.56$ mol of $KOH$, therefore 3.56 mol of nitric acid is needed

A solution has a pH = 9.55. What is the concentration of H3O+ in the solution, in mol L-1?

You perform a titration with 1.48 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and find that 3.81 x 10-2 L are required to reach the equivalence point (as determined using a coloured indicator). What is the concentration of the hydrochloric acid?
$\frac{1.48M \times 0.0381L}{0.0409L} = 1.3786797066 = 1.38M$
