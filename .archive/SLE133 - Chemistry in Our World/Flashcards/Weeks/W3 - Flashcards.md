# Rules
Aufbau principle description :: Describes how [[Orbitals|orbitals]] are filled as the number of electrons in an atom increase; directly leads to the [[Periodic Table structure|structure of the periodic table]] 

Aufbau Principle rules
??
1. Each electron occupies the most stable energy level (shell/$n$)
2. No two electrons can have the exact same [[Quantum numbers|quantum numbers]] 

Hund's First Rule (Rule of Maximum Multiplicity. )
??
1. Every orbital in a sublevel is singly occupied before any orbital is doubly occupied.
2. All of the electrons in singly occupied orbitals have the same spin (to maximize total spin).

# Valency
What does Iodine, Chlorine, and Astatine have in common? :: They all have 7 valence electrons
Electron configuration shorthand :: \[First noble gas before given element] \<shell config starting from the next shell> e.g. Vanadium = $[Ar]4s^{2} 3d^{3}$
Electron configuration (fully written) - Krypton ($Kr$) ::: $1s^{2} 2s^{2} 2p^{6} 3s^{2} 3p^{6} 3d^{10} 4s^{2} 4p^{6}$
Electron configuration (fully written) - Vanadium ($V$) ::: $1s^{2} 2s^{2} 2p^{6} 3s^{2} 3p^{6} 4s^{2} 3d^{3}$
Electron configuration (shorthand) - Gold ($Au$) ::: $[Xe]6s^{2} 6p^{6} 4f^{14} 5d^{3}$
$[Xe] 4f^{14} 5d^{10} 6s^{1}$
Xe = 54S electrons + 2s+6p+4f=76 -> 79 electrons

Do atoms prefer half-filled or fully filled shells to become stable? :: Both. An unevenly filled shell (such as 4 up spins and 2 down) would unstable 
Why do atoms like $Au$ have an unfilled last shell ($[Xe] 4f^{14} 5d^{10} 6s^{1}$)? :: Due to 
$Cu$ electron configuration :: 

Energy levels are quantised to certain energy levels
90% of electrons will be found in a given orbital, 10% slightly out

# Misc.
Why does $Cu$ (copper) not follow the intuitive configuration of
?
We would expect it to be $[Ar] 4s^{2} 3d^{9}$. This would give the electron configuration:  ($4s^{2}$) ↑↓  ($3d^{9}$) ↑↓ ↑↓ ↑↓ ↑↓ ↑_ 
Due to Hund's first rule of Maximum Multiplicity, an electron configuration prefers to be either all aligned in one direction or full. This means the configuration is actually: ($4s^{1}$) ↑_ ($3d^{10}$) ↑↓ ↑↓ ↑↓ ↑↓ ↑↓, making $4s$ fully aligned up, and $3d$ full.

Degenerate orbital :: An orbital that has the same energy level as another

Isoelectronic atom-ion :: An atom having the same number of electrons as an ion (e.g. $F^{-}$=$Ne$'s 10')

Cations vs anion size :: Cations are always smaller and anions larger than the corresponding neutral atom. This is because cations will be at a previous shell and anions at the next and positive charge shrinks the atom.

What does electron spin correspond to? :: Magnetic properties of an atom. Unpaired electrons mean a non-net-zero spin and is therefore paramagnetic.
Paramagnetic :: The amount of magnetism an atom displays; proportional to the number of unpaired electrons (e.g. $Fe$'s d-shell' has a `^ ^ ^ ^ ^`  spin, so the net spin is ($5 \times +\frac{1}{2}$)
What blocks out of ${s, p, d, f}$ are more likely to be diamagnetic? :: $s \text{ and } p$
What blocks out of ${s, p, d, f}$ are more likely to be paramagnetic? :: $d \text{ and } f$

What is the trend of atomic size? :: Size increases from top-bottom (as $n$ increases, orbitals are larger) and shrinks left-right ($n$ is the same, but more protons mean electrons are pulled closer)

Ionisation energy :: The amount of energy ($kj/mol^{-1}$) needed to remove a given electron in an atom
True or False: As positive charge increases, so does the difficulty in ionisation :: True. As an atom becomes more positive, the ionisation energy will always be higher than the first ionisation energy as the atom wants to keep electrons
First Ionisation Energy :: The amount of energy ($kj/mol^{-1}$) needed to remove the first electron in an atom. This increases across groups and less down periods
Electron affinity :: Spontaneous energy released when an electron joins an atom
