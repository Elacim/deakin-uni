<!-- Light and it's characteristics -->
The four characteristics of light ::: Frequency ($v$), Wavelength (**$\lambda$**), Amplitude, and Phase
Frequency of light ::: Number of crests/maximums passing a point in space in Hz ($v$)
Wavelength of light ::: Distance between crests/maximums ($\lambda$)
Amplitude of light ::: Max displacement of a wave from the centre
Phase of light ::: The changing of the start/end point of a wave by shifting it left/right
The Frequency and Wavelength of light is ==inversely proportional== to each other ::: Inversely proportional
What characteristic of light determines the intensity? ::: Amplitude
What is the speed of light ($c$)? :: $2.998*10{^8}$ $m/s^{â€“1}$
Does wavelength or frequency impact the speed of light? :: No. All electromagnetic radiation travels at the speed of light, $c$
Can light be considered a particle and a wave? :: True.

Photon energy formulas
??
$E=hv$
$E=\frac{hc}{\lambda}$
$E$=Photon energy; $h$=Planck constant; $f/v$=photon frequency
$c$=speed of light in a vacuum; and $\lambda$=photon wavelength

\\WHY IS LIGHT A PARTICLE AND A WAVE?\
\\RESEARCH MORE ON THE PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT\\

A light shone through a tube filled with gas into a prism produces an ==absorption spectrum== :: Absorption spectrum
Absorption spectrum :: The visualisation of the absorption of exact frequencies of photons correlated to an electron's specific energy level. The dark lines on the spectrum indicate the energy was absorbed, with the coloured lines indicating the energy did not interact with the atom; an emission spectrum will show the exact inverse 

An electrically charged tube filled with gas shining into a prism produces an ==emission spectrum== :: Emission spectrum
Emission spectrum :: The visualisation of the emission of exact frequencies ($v$) of photons correlated to an electron's specific energy level. The coloured lines on the spectrum indicate the energy was emitted from the atom's electrons after they were briefly interacted with from a photon; an absorption spectrum will show the exact inverse 



<!-- [[Quantum numbers]]  -->
What are *n*, *l*, m${_l}$, and m${_s}$ known as? ::: The four [[Quantum numbers|quantum numbers]] 
What is the quantum number *n*? ::: The principle quantum number denoting the energy of the electron and is correlated to the size of the orbital
What is the quantum number *l*? ::: The azimuthal quantum number denoting the subshell/sublevel region/shape
What is the quantum number $m{_l}$,? ::: The magnetic quantum number denoting the possible orientations of the subshell/sublevels
What is the quantum number $m{_s}$,? ::: The spin quantum number denoting the $+\frac{1}{2}$ (upwards) or $-\frac{1}{2}$ (downwards) spin of an electron

What factors/facts can imply an electron is less bound to a nucleus?
?
A higher $n$ value (and therefore higher orbital),
A large atomic radius,
An electron with a lot of energy

What is an orbital? :: An orbital is the configurations given by finding $m_{l}$. $p$ has 3 orbitals and $d$ has 5.

What is the order of the subshells? :: $s$, $p$, $d$, $f$, and $g$ ($l={0..4}$)
Equation for calculating $m_{l}$ ::: $\{-l...+l\}$
Possible values for $m_{s}$ ::: $+\frac{1}{2}$ (upwards) or $-\frac{1}{2}$ (downwards)
<!--SR:!2023-07-13,1,230-->

How many electrons can an $l=0$ $(s)$ subshell fill? :: An $s$ subshell has an $m{_l}$ of 0 $\therefore$ 1 orientation $\therefore$ 2 electrons
How many electrons can an $l=1$ $(p)$ subshell fill? :: A $p$ subshell has an $m{_l}$ of -1..1 $\therefore$ 3 orientations $\therefore$ 2\*3 orientations = 6 electrons
How many electrons can an $l=2$ $(d)$ subshell fill? :: A $d$ subshell has an $m{_l}$ of -2..2 $\therefore$ 5 orientations $\therefore$ 2\*5 orientations = 10 electrons
How many electrons can an $l=3$ $(f)$ subshell fill? :: An $f$ subshell has an $m{_l}$ of -3..3 $\therefore$ 7 orientations $\therefore$ 2\*7 orientations = 14 electrons
How many electrons can an $l=4$ $(g)$ subshell fill? :: A $g$ subshell has an $m{_l}$ of -4..4 $\therefore$ 9 orientations $\therefore$ 2\*9 orientations = 18 electrons

What is an atom's ground state? :: The ground state of an electron, the energy level it normally occupies, is the state of lowest energy for that electron. [Source - NASA (atom.html)](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/toolbox/atom.html)

An electron can change to any orbital at any time regardless of energy level :: False. Each orbital has a specific energy associated with it. For an electron to be boosted to an orbital with a higher energy, it must overcome the difference in energy between the orbital it is in, and the orbital to which is is going. This means that it must absorb a photon that contains precisely that amount of energy, or take exactly that amount of energy from another particle in a collision. [Source - NASA (atom.html)](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/toolbox/atom.html)

How do electrons behave when going from an excited state to a lower/ground state? :: They emit a photon with the same energy as the photon that was absorbed. $\Delta E_{atom}=\pm hv_{photon}$ (The change ($\Delta$) in energy ($E$) of the atom is $\pm$ Planck's constant ($h$) \* the photon's frequency ($v$), depending on if the photon is being absorbed ($+$) or emitted ($-$)). [Source - NASA (atom.html)](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/toolbox/atom.html)

In an excited atom, does the excess energy provided by a photon **always** result in a photon being emitted with the exact same frequency? :: No. While it can result in the exact frequency, it often loses energy through changes in energy

Spontaneous emission ::: When a photon is released from an exited atom moving to a ground state

Excited atom :: An atom in a high-energy state triggered by photons colliding with electrons and collisions with other atoms (at an exact energy level required to move up one or more shells)

Attractive or repulsive force between two electrically charged objects ::: Electrostatic Force


Electron in motion :: An electron moving in a conductive material or as a free, unbound electron with an $E>0$ ($E$ = energy)

An electron that is free/unbound **and** is stationary/at rest :: An electron that is free from an atom with an $E=0$ ($E$ = energy) [[Chemistry Core Concepts - Allan Blackman, Daniel Southam, -exclude.pdf#page=255|[Source] Chemistry Core Concepts, page 255, para 1]]

Bound electron :: An electron that is considered to be a part of an atom and is attracted to the nucleus with an $E<0$ ($E$ = energy)


The Pauli Exclusion Principle ::: Each electron has a unique set of quantum numbers. Due to there being two spin values, this means there can only be a maximum of two electrons within a given orbital.

Hund's First Rule (Rule of Maximum Multiplicity)
??
1. Every orbital in a sublevel is singly occupied before any orbital is doubly occupied.
2. All of the electrons in singly occupied orbitals have the same spin (to maximize total spin).

Why does a $He^{+}$ cation have different spectra to a $H$ atom? :: 
The electron in $H$ would be less attracted to the atom's single proton, meaning the electric field is weaker ($1e^{-}+1p^{+}=0_{charge}$) while a $He{^+}$ cation would have a higher positive electric field attracting the single electron ($1e^{-}+2p^{+}=+1_{charge}$). This means that the electron in each atom will need different energy inputs (i.e. photons) to move up energy levels and back down. This will be visible as differing spectra.
