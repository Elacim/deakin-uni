Anything in the periodic table is an element (e.g. Calcium, Sodium, Hydrogen, Uranium)
	- e.g. CaCl is not an element, it is a molecule (chemical -> compound -> molecule)

"Atomic nuclei with an odd amount of protons \[e.g. 43 protons] are less stable than those with even numbers, even when the total number of nucleons... is even, and odd numbered elements have fewer stable isotopes." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technetium#Isotopes

Uranium is the largest naturally occurring element.
Tc (43) is very unstable.
