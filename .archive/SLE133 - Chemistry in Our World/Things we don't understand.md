Is it more correct to call $H^{+}$ a cation rather than an ion?

What is the purpose of neutrons in a nucleus? From what I understand, it's stability. Is that true?


What chapters are going to be covered on the exam? Or at least the main focuses?

Are cations smaller than the corresponding neutral atom?

Do we have to remember sigma and pi bonds?
Also, why do pi bonds do that split thing?

Is there a method to remembering the solubility rules? Some of it's sticking...
