What is the boiling point?
The temperature at which the average kinetic energy of molecular motion balances the attractive energy of intermolecular attractions
huh?

Why do liquids prefer a smaller surface area? 
Why does a higher polarity lead to a higher surface tension?

Do we have to remember all the gas laws? Or just the pv=nRT and P1 times V1/Temperature one?

Are we ever going to talk about what's in between atoms? The ~99.9% 'nothing'? Empty space?
I've heard something about the nothingness being a quantum sea of constantly creating and destroying positive and anti quantum particles

### First law of Thermodynamics
What is 'internal energy'? :: The sum of all the kinetic and potential energies of the components of the system
What does $\Delta U$/$\Delta E$ represent? ::: The change in the internal energy of the system
How do you find $\Delta U$/$\Delta E$? :: $\Delta U = q + w$ ($q$=heat, $w$=work)
In the formula $\Delta U = q + w$, what does $q$ represent? :: Heat that is transferred to or from the system
In the formula $\Delta U = q + w$, what does $w$ represent? :: The work done or on by the system
If 2044 kJ 
When a reaction is carried out under constant external pressure, $q$, representing the heat within the system, can be written as $q_{p}$. This is the heat transferred at constant pressure. $q_{p}$ is equal to the change in enthalpy (heat flow), or $\Delta H$ 
True or False: Most chemical reactions are performed under constant pressure :: True. 
Why is $\Delta H$ usually used over the total energy in a system ($\Delta U$/$\Delta E$)? :: The work exerted by the system tends to be low and $q$ (heat) produced is higher, and because most reactions are done at a constant pressure, $q_{p}=\Delta H$ matters more than the total energy ($\Delta U$) 

What does $\Delta H$ denote? :: Enthalpy, or the change in heat flow (kJ/mol)
What does $\Delta S$ denote? :: The change in entropy (joules/mol/Kelvin)
What does $\Delta G$ denote? :: Gibbs free energy (kJ/mol)

Hess' law - 

Chemical reactions & physical change occurs in one particular direction only when under particular conditions of temperature and pressure. 
	This is known as being a spontaneous process
Chemical thermodynamics allow bidirectional prediction and the extent of spontaneity in particular conditions

Heat
Heat is a transfer of energy due to a temperature difference
	- object of high temp to another of low temp
- Measured in Kelvin
True or false: Heat and temperature are the same thing :: False.
Work and heat is in Joules (slide 3b)


### Systems
A system is a particular part of the universe (for example, one+ chemical species)
Everything else is surroundings. Both is 
A system can be anything (whatever we're studying, like a piston in an engine block or a beaker)
Universe -> Surroundings -> Boundary -> System
Isolated system? The universe is an isolated system - nothing flows in/out

Types of systems :: Open, closed, and isolated
Open system :: Can gain/lose mass/energy across their boundaries
Closed system :: Can absorb/release energy, but not mass, across the boundary
Isolated system :: Cannot exchange matter/energy with surroundings

What is a water jar with a tight lid on it an example of in regards to systems? :: Closed. It can absorb/release energy but not mass.

$\Delta X$:
How are changes in temperature defined as? :: $\Delta T =  T_{final} - T_{initial}$
What can changes in temperature be applied to? :: Chemical changes and physical changes 
- Chemical changes are chemical reactions

State function - path independent. Path always reaches a point identically no matter the path?

What is a state function? :: A property that does not depend on the path taken to reach that value. An example being the first law of thermodynamics $\Delta U=q+w$
What is a call path function? :: A property where the resulting value depends on the path taken to calculate the values
First law of thermodynamics equation :: $\Delta U = q + w$, where $q$=heat and $w$=work
Is $\Delta U$ a state function? :: Yes. The path taken does not matter in the end. 
Are $q$ and $w$ state functions? :: No. Values of them are dependent on the path of the change.
First law of thermodynamics explanation
?
- Energy can be transferred between systems as either heat or work

- Law of conservation of energy

A system does 45J of work and receives 28J of heat, what is the value of $\Delta U$ for this change? :: $\Delta U=+28J + -45J \rightarrow -17J$. As it does 45J of work, this is energy flowing out (-). It receiving 28J of heat is energy going in (+)
Energy in syntax :: $+ve$
Energy out syntax :: $-ve$

What is work defined as? :: Simply, it is the motion against an opposite force
Most common type of work encountered in chemical systems :: Compression and expansion of gas
What is pressure-volume ($pV$) work? :: Work done to enable the compression or expansion of gas
What is the formula for work? :: $w=-p \times \Delta V$
What is the unit for work? :: Joules (J)
What two units is 1 joule (J) equivalent to? ::

?
$w=-101,325pA(2.5L-5L) \rightarrow w=253J$

Can heat capacity be measured directly? :: No. We instead calculate it based on temperature changes ($\Delta T$)
Formula for the relationship between heat and temperature (dependent on substance amount) :: $q=C \times \Delta T$, where $C$=heat capacity in $J K^{-1}$  (joules kelvin)

Formula for the relationship between heat and temperature
Heat capacity can be thought of as the amount of heat required to increase the temperature of an object by a particular amount


What does calorimetry determine? :: The heat based on recording temperature changes
Two main types of calorimeters :: Those that operate under conditions of constant volume and those that operate under conditions of constant pressure
How does the bomb calorimeter work? :: The burning of food within the bomb releases energy into the surrounding water. This $\Delta T$ and the knowledge of the calorimeter heat capacity allows the determining of the specific heat released.


What is Enthalpy? :: The heat of reaction at a constant pressure ($\Delta H$)
Formula for enthalpy? :: $\Delta H = q_{p}$, where $q_{p}$ is the heat of reaction at constant pressure. 

What is an endothermic reaction in terms of the system? :: The system has heat ($q$) transferred in from the surroundings 
What is an exothermic reaction in terms of the system? :: The system has released heat ($q$) out into the surroundings 
Is a $\Delta _{r} H > 0$ reaction endo or exothermic? :: Endothermic
Is a $\Delta _{r} H < 0$ reaction endo or exothermic? :: Exothermic
What is the reaction type when energy is absorbed? :: Endothermic - $\Delta _{r} H > 0$
What is the reaction type when energy is released? :: Exothermic - $\Delta _{r} H < 0$

Difference between $\Delta _{r} H$ and $\Delta _{r} U$ = $p \Delta V$ (..-.. = work done)
$\Delta _{r} U$ :: first law of thermodynamics 
$\Delta _{r} H$ :: 
This difference can be large for reactions involving gases, but not for reactions involving only liquids and solids

Heat transfer example - Slide 13a

The standard enthalpy of reaction ($\Delta H^{\theta}$) is the value of $\Delta H$ - Slide 14a
	- conducted at a temperature ($T$)
	- stoichiometric coefficients for all reactants refer to actual mole \#
	- SI unit is J/mol but usually written as kJ/mol

The amount of heat transferred during a change from one direction is equivalent to the other direction but inverse - only the direction is different

A: $2H_{2} + O_{2} = 2H_{2}O$ - spontaneous reaction, it happens naturally
B: $2H_{2}O \rightarrow 2H_{2} + O_{2}$ - hydrolysis. When the electric current is taken away, the reaction stops ()
Enthalpy change: $H_{A} = -H_{B}$ and $H_{B} = -H_{A}$
Ice to liquid water -> $\Delta H$ = $6.02$ KJ/mol
Liquid water to ice -> $\Delta H$ = $-6.02$ KJ/mol

Law of conservation of energy :: Energy can neither be created nor destroyed in any physical or chemical change


Hess' law :: Method for combining known thermochemical equations in a way that allows us to calculate $\Delta H^{\theta}$ for another reaction
- The overall enthalpy change for a chemical reaction is constant, regardless of procedure
	- a 1 step process is the same overall enthalpy change as a multiple step process
Manipulating thermochemical equations: (Slides 16a-17a)
1. When an equation is reversed, the sign of $\Delta _{r}H^{\theta}$ must also be reversed
2. Formulae can be cancelled from both sides of an equation only if they're in an identical state
3. If all coefficients of an equation are $\times$/$\div$ by the same factor, the value of $\Delta _{r}H^{\theta}$ must also be $\times$/$\div$ by this factor

### Entropy
Spontaneous processes tend to proceed from states of low probability to states of higher probability
Spontaneous processes tend to disperse energy
Entropy is a measure of the ways of dispersing energy in a system

True or false: Entropy is a state function :: True
Entropy formula :: $\Delta _{r} S = S_{products} - S_{reactants}$  In J mol$^{-1}K^{-1}$
True or false: Increased temperature means increased entropy

Any event that is accompanied by an increase in the entropy of the system has a tendency to occur spontaneously

What is entropy? :: The number of equivalent ways that energy can be distributed in the system
Factors that affect entropy :: Volume, temperature, physical state, and the number of particles
How does volume affect entropy? :: A volume of $0.1m^{3}$ being expanded to $0.2m^{3}$ increases entropy
How does temperature affect entropy? :: The higher the temperature, the higher the entropy
How does physical state (phases) affect entropy? :: Solids have a low entropy whereas gases have a high entropy
How do the number of particles affect entropy? :: An increase in particles increases entropy due to the now increased number of ways the particles can move

Moisture condensing on outside of cold glass - Decrease - 
Rain drops forming in cloud - Decrease - into vapour
Frost forming on the windscreen of the car - decrease
Sugar dissolving in coffee - increase. The sugar dissolving from it's crystalline state to being in solution increases entropy

Is the entropy increasing or decreasing for $2SO_{2} + O_{2} \rightarrow 2SO_{3}$? :: Decrease. 3 particles of gas are turning into 2 particles of gas


### Gibbs energy and reaction spontaneity
- the decider of whether or not something is spontaneous
- If Enthalpy and Entropy are disfavoured, the reaction is **not** spontaneous
The Second Law of Thermodynamics - whenever a spontaneous event takes place in the universe, the total entropy increases ($\Delta S_{total} > 0$)
If entropy decreases in a room, what happens to the surroundings? :: The surroundings gain the lost entropy

Two factors that influence chemical reaction favourability (enthalpy and entropy) - silde 25b
Gibbs energy (G) - measure of whether a chemical reaction will proceed spontaneously or not - $G=H-TS$ or 
Release/absorption of heat and increase/decrease in entropy determines spontaneity
Gibbs energy formula :: $\Delta G = \Delta H - (T \times \Delta S)$ (Gibbs energy = Enthalpy minus temperature times entropy)
What value of $\Delta G$ indicates spontaneity? :: Any value below 0 ($<0$)
What value of $\Delta G$ indicates non-spontaneity? :: Any value above 0 ($0>$)
What value of $\Delta G$ indicates equilibrium? :: Equilibrium (0)

For $\Delta G$ subliming lead at room temperature, use
$\Delta H$=195kJ/mol$^{-1}$
$\Delta S$=-110 J mol$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$
$\Delta G = 195kJ - (25C+273.15) \times \frac{-110J}{1000}$
-> $\Delta G=228 kJ/mol^{-1}$
Is this process spontaneous? No, as $\Delta G$ is positive

When $\Delta H$ and $\Delta S$ have the same sign (+ or -), the value of $T$ determines $\Delta G$ 

|     | +H                                            | -H                                               |
| --- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| +S  | Spont. at high temps, Non-spont. at low temps | Spont. at all temps                              |
| -S  | Non-spont. at all temps                       | Non-spont. at high temps and spont. at low temps |

Slide 29a
Important points about spontaneity and free energy
A spontaneous process, once begun, proceeds without any external assistance and is
exergonic; that is, free energy is released and it has a negative value of Î”G.
A nonspontaneous process requires continuous external influence and is endergonic; that
is, free energy is added and it has a positive value of Î”G.
The value of Î”G for the reverse of a reaction is numerically equal to the value of Î”G for the forward
reaction, but has the opposite sign.
Some nonspontaneous processes become spontaneous with a change in temperature.

$C + H_{2}O \rightarrow CO + H_{2}$ -> H=+131kJ/mol
What is the $\Delta G$?
	$131kJ - (300K \times 0.134 J)$
	= $90.8kJ$
At what temperature will this be spontaneous?
	$G = H - T \times S$
	-> $T = \frac{\Delta H}{\Delta S}$
		-> $\frac{131kJ}{0.134J}=978K$ ($1251.13Â°C$)
