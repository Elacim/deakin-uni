#### Solids:
	- Fixed volume and shape
	- Cannot be compressed, can be malleable
	- Atoms arranged in a regular pattern, tight knit
#### Liquids:
	- Fixed volume
	- Shape changes to fill container
	- Cannot be compressed -> will find a weakness and flow through that
	- Atoms close but not in an organised arrangement
#### Gasses:
	- Variable volume and shape
	- Expands to fill the container
	- Easily compressed
	- Molecules are far apart, free to move independently


Question: Butane has a melting point of -138.4°C and boiling point of -0.5°C.
What is it's state at 25°C?
It would be a gas as it is above the boiling point.
```
Solid:   < melting point
Liquid:  >= melting point and < boiling point
Gas:     >= boiling point
```
