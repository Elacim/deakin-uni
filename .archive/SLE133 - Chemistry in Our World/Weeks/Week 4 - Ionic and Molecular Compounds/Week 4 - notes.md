6.5 - Covalent bond properties


Bond length - max energy over other atoms
Bond energy - energy required to broke a bond (in kJ/mol). Always positive. Differing chemical bonds have differing and repeatable bond length and energy

$H^{2}$ - 300pm = no interaction; 74pm = the length of the H-H bond providing max stability (repulsive and attractive forces in balance); <74pm = too much repulsion and no interaction

Slide 6 - Sigma ($\sigma$) bonds??
Slide 7 - diatomic molecules - $F_{2}$ - 3 2p [[Orbitals]], each at a right angle to each other. The single electron in one of the 2p orbitals approaches the opposite nucleus
	- $F-F$ bond -> sharing of 2 electrons from the fluorine 2p orbitals pointing at each other

2 different atoms forming a molecule can have an uneven distribution of bonding electrons - polar covalent bond. e.g. With $HF$ (hydrogen fluoride), $F$ has more time spent with the electrons (the density is higher) giving it a slightly negative charge ($-\delta$). The actual molecule is neutral.
Electronegativity - numerical values of strength of atom attracting electrons in a given bond. Shown by $\chi$.

The more electronegative atom in a polar bond attracts a greater share of the electron density

Electronegativity increases bottom to top, and increases going across (slide 17)

Slide 18 - Research a bit more
Non-polar covalent $\approx$ 0.0..~0.5 $\chi$  ($PH_{3}$, $H_{2}$). Likely gas at room temp ($CS_{2}$ - low $\chi$)
Polar covalent $\approx$ 0.5..~2.0 $\chi$  ($HF$). Solid/Liquid/Gas at room temp ($H_{2}O$)
Ionic $\approx$ 2.0-3.3 $\chi$  ($Na^{+}Cl^{-}$, $NaF$) - held together purely by attractive forces. Likely solid at room temp. Non metal will likely rip away electrons from metal. Usually non-metal->metal bond. Ammonia (ionic) is an exception. ($NaBr$) -> Slide 12

#### Ionic compounds
https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/General_Chemistry/Nomenclature
- Cation (metal) followed by anion (non-metal)
- Must have $\delta \text{ of } 0$, which also allows us to find the metal's charge from the anion's charge and count 
- Ionic compounds are made of molecules - Positive and negative ions usually forming a type of lattice, which is not a molecule
	- Ratio of cations:anions in infinite lattice
	- empirical formula ??
- Hydrates - $H_{2}O$ in structure ($Ca(NO_{3})_{2} \text{ } 4H_{2}O$)

- Many transition metals can form different cations
	- $Fe$ can donate 2 electrons or 3, leading to different ionic compounds being formed
		- e.g. $FeCl_{2}$ -> $Fe^{2+}$
		- e.g. $FeCl_{3}$ -> $Fe^{3+}$
	- These differing ion charges are also named their oxidation state - so $Fe^{3+}$ has an oxidation state of 3
	- $Al^{3+}+Cl_{3}$ - Aluminium needs 3 electrons and Chlorine can give them 

$Ca^{2+} + I^-$ -> $CaI_{2}$
$Ca^{2+} + O^{2-}$ -> $Ca_{2}O_{2}$ -> $CaO$
$Ca^{2+} + N^{3-}$ -> $Ca_3N_2$ ($Ca$: 3\*2=6+ and $N$: 2\*3=6-)

Binary ionic compounds:
- Written with cation first and anion (which takes the '-ide' suffix)
- Potassium Iodide: $KI$
- Calcium Fluoride: $CaF_{2}$

Nitrogen oxide or monoxide - $NO$
Nitrogen dioxide - $NO_{2}$

Slide 15a
Iron (II) chloride -> $FeCl_{2}$
Iron (III) chloride -> $FeCl_{3}$
Tin (II) chloride -> $SnCl_{2}$
Tin (IV) chloride -> $SnCl_{4}$

$Rb_{2}S$ -> Rubidium Sulfide  ($Rb$ has $^{+1}$ charge, $S^{-2}$ -> we can assume there are $Rb_2$)
$CoI_{2}$ -> Cobalt (II) Iodide  (Co has 2+, I has 2-)
$K_{3}N$ -> Potassium Nitride  (N has 3 bonds to fill, K has 1e to spare -> $K_{3}$)
	$Fe_{2}O_{3}$ -> Iron (III) Oxide (8\*2=16. 6\*3=18) - 18:16 = 9:8

Ionic compounds may be polyatomic (more than 1 atom)
- Ammonium ($NH_{4}^{+}$)
- Nitrate ($NO_{3}^{-}$)
- A polyatomic ion is charge because electron number is different from proton count ($NH_{4}^{+}$ - has one more proton than electrons) (slide 15b)
Use brackets and subscripts - $Ca(NO_{3})_{2}$ - 1 $Ca^{2+}$ cation for every 2 $NO_{3}^{-}$ anions
Oxyanions are the most important polyatomic ions
	- Carbonate ($CO_{3} \text{} ^{2-}$)
	- Sulfite ($SO_{3} \text{} ^{2-}$)
	- Sulfate ($SO_{4} \text{} ^{2-}$)
- $ClO^{-}$ -> hypochlorite
- $ClO^{2-}$ -> chlorite
- $ClO^{3-}$ -> chlorate
- $ClO^{4-}$ -> perchlorate (more oxygen = per)

- $NO_{3} \text{} ^{-}$ - nitrate
- $NO_{2} \text{} ^{-}$ - nitrite
- $N^{3-}$ - nitride
Naming polyatomic ions - slide 17a
Various ions found in SLE133 - slide 17b

$MnO$ - Manganese (II) oxide. 
$Cr_{2}(SO_{4})_{3}$ - Chromium (III) Sulfate
	- $3SO_{4} \text{} ^{2-}$ -> 3\*2- charge = 6- charge
	- $2Cr$ -> 6+ charge

- $Rb$ and nitrate, sulfate, and phosphate
	- $RbNO_{3}$, $Rb_{2}SO_{4}$, and $Rb_{3}PO_{4}$
- $Sr$ with nitrate, sulfate and phosphate
	- $Sr(NO_{3})_{2}$, $SrSO_{4}$, and $Sr_{3}(PO_{4})_{2}$
- $In$ with nitrate, sulfate and phosphate (In has 3+ charge)
	- $In(NO_{2})_{3}$, $In_{2}(SO_{4})_3$, $InPO_{4}$ 


#### Non-metal compounds:
- Never use 'mono' on 1st element
- Some prefixes get shortened
	- monooxide=monoxide
	- pentaoxide=pentoxide
$SCl_{2}$ = Sulfur Chloride = Sulfur Dichloride (sulfur is leftest so it's first)
$N_{2}O_{5}$ = Dinitrogen pentoxide
$SF_{6}$ = Sulfur Hexafluoride

| No. Atoms | Prefix |
| --------- | ------ |
| 1         | mono-  |
| 2         | di-    |
| 3         | tri-   |
| 4         | tetra- |
| 5         | penta- |
| 6         | hexa-  |
| 7         | hepta- |
| 8         | octa-  |
| 9         | nona-  |

# Covalent bonding and molecular compounds - slide 19+
More metal-like (further to left and down column) element is usually first in naming:
Carbon Dioxide - carbon (6) is before oxygen (8)
If both elements are from the same group, the heavier element is first
	- e.g. Carbon (6) and silicon (14) would be $SiC$

Majority of complex molecular compounds are carbon-containing compounds
	- Carbon first, Hydrogen second, other elements in Alphabetical order
		- $C_{4}H_{10}$, $C_{4}H_{9}BrO$
Molecular formula: specifies # of each atom in a molecule of a substance
Empirical formula: Specifies the simplest ratio of each atom in the substance
	- Why we want it: what \% of a molecule is necessary to 
	- decomposing to elements, comparing masses, simplify to a whole number ratio
	- use mass spectrometer to find the mass of a molecule, the multiply the mass with the ratio to find the chemical formula
		- mass spectrometer also reveals the bonds (not the structure though)
Remember that a formula does not give information about the chemical structure or atom attachments


#### Structural formulae
- not accurate 3D representations
- shows how atoms are bound to each other
- bonds are shown as lines
- When translating to chemical formulae, follow non-metal rules (carbon first etc.)
	- Count number of atoms of each type
	- If no carbon, follow:
		- Elements (except H) further to the left on periodic table appear first 
		- Hydrogen written last except when with group 16 or 17
		- If both elements are from the same group, the heaviest element appears first

#### Dipole moment
- Most chemical bonds are polar (one end slightly positive, the other slightly negative)
- Bond polarities can lead to molecules with 'dipole moment'
- Depends on bond polarities ($\Delta \chi$) and on molecular shape
- Polarity is a vector - 

Bond lengths vary from 70-250pm
