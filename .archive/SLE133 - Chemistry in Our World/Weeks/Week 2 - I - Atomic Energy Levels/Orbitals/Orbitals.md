Orbitals are areas (shape of space) within atoms where there is a high probability of finding electrons.
	- This means that there may be a 90% chance of finding an electron within this area. There is still a 10% chance that it is not within a given area.
	- "In quantum mechanics, \[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle] is any of a variety of mathematical inequalities asserting a fundamental limit to the accuracy with which the values for certain pairs of physical quantities of a particle, such as position, x, and momentum, p, can be predicted from initial conditions." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle)
	- 'Orbit' is a misnomer taken from Bohr's model. They do not orbit - we can not know the path they are taking.

Knowing electron arrangement is important as it governs atom-atom interaction

1s, 2p etc.
<number> <letter>

The letter designates the shape
The number designates the energy level

s = sphere
p = cross-peanut/cross-dumbell shape

```

Helium (2e) ->$1s{^2}$
Lithium (3e) -> $1s{^2}2s{^1}$
Boron (5e) -> $1s{^2}2s{^2}2p{^1}$
Neon (10e) -> $1s{^2}2s{^2}2p{^6}$
Sodium (11e) -> $1s{^2}2s{^2}2p{^6}3s{^1}$


The 2s electrons energy > 1s electrons. Therefore, on average, the 2s electrons are more distant from the nucleus and the orbital larger


s orbital (spherical shape):

p orbitals (cross-peanut/cross-dumbell shape):
![[p-orbitals shape, L=1.png|300]]
There are three 2p orbitals, 2p$_{x}$, 2p$_{y}$, & 2p$_{z}$
Each of these can still only hold 2 electrons for a total of 6 between the 3.
	- Each orbital gets 1 electron each before pairing starts

d orbitals (various egg shapes + one donut):
![[D_orbitals.png|400]]
There are 5 d-orbitals:
- $d_{yz}$
- $d_{xy}$
- $d_{xz}$
- $d_{z{^2}}$
- $d_{y{^2}-z{^2}}$
Each one can still only hold 2 electrons.

Orbitals can 'combine' - called *hybridisation*. They attempt to form the most stable shape. 
Oxygen + 2 Hydrogen = Water
$1s{^2}2s{^2}2p{^6}+1s{^{2}}+1s{^2}$ = $2p{^{3}}$ hybrid orbital
This 2p3 orbital is a tetrahedron (4 oblong spheres put together) where wherever two electrons happen to go, they are always going to be right next to each other. This is what makes water polar.
