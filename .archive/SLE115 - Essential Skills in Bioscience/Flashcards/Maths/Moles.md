Concentration formula :: $\text{Concentration}=\frac{\text{amount}} {\text{volume}}$

What is molar mass ($M$)? :: The weight in grams per mol ($M$=$g/mol$)
What is molarity? :: Number of moles of solute dissolved in 1 litre of solvent (concentration put into mol/L)
Molarity equation ::: $M$=$\frac{\text{no. of moles}}{\text{volume (L)}}$

What is a $1M$ solution telling us? :: That the 1 litre solution contains 1 mole of a given compound
What does '$2M$ $NaCl$ solution' mean? :: It means it contains two moles of $NaCl/L$
Calculate a $2M$ $NaCl$ solution's $\text{gl}^{-1}$ :: $NaCl$'s molecular weight is $59.44u$. A $2M$ $NaCl$ solution contains $\frac{59.44 \times 2}{1L}=118.88 \rightarrow 118.88\text{gl}^{-1}$

What is the 'mole formula' triangle layout? :: $m$ (mass (g)) up top, $n$ (mole count) in the bottom left, and $M$ (molar mass (g/mol)) in the bottom right
What are the three formulas for finding $n$, $m$, and $M$? :: ![[Mole formula triangle.jpg|300]]

What does $\%w/w$ mean? :: Percentage of weight/weight
What does $\%v/v$ mean? :: Percentage of volume/volume
What does $\%w/v$ mean? :: Percentage of weight/volume. The number of grams/100mL.
If $\%x/x$ is not defined, what is the default formula assumption? :: $\%w/v$ (weight/volume)

In the context of $8.2\% w/v$, what does the '$8.2\%$' mean? :: It means that $8.2\%$ of $100\text{mL}$ of a given solvent is solute. It also means there is $8.2$ grams of a solute in that $100\text{mL}$ of solvent.

Steps to find the $\%w/v$
?
$(M \times u) \times \frac{100mL}{1L} = \%w/v$
1. Find the weight of the substance (molarity $\times$ molecular weight = grams of a substance)
	1. $M \times u = \text{grams}$
2. Find the $\%w/v$ of the grams in $100\text{mL}$ of solution ($\text{grams} \times \frac{\text{desired mL}}{\text{litre amount}}=\%w/v$)
	1. $\text{grams} \times \frac{100mL}{1L}=\%w/v$


What is the $\%w/v$ of a $2M$ $NaCl$ solution ($NaCl=58.44u$)?
?
$2M \times 58.44u=116.88g$  (molarity times molecular weight)
In 100mL, $116.88g \times \frac{100mL}{1L}=11.688g$
$2M$ $NaCl$ solution $=$ $11.7\%w/v$ $NaCl$ solution

Find the molarity ($M$) of $5\% w/v$ $NaCl$
?
$5\% w/v$ $NaCl=\frac{5g}{100mL}=50\text{gl}^{-1}$
$NaCl$'s molecular mass = $58.44$
$50\text{gl}^{-1}=\frac{50g}{58.44}=0.86M$
A $5\%$ $NaCl$ solution $=0.86M$ solution

Find the $\%w/v$ of a $0.86M$ $NaCl$ solution
?
$0.86M \times 58.44u = 50.2584g$
In 100mL, $50.2584g \times \frac{100mL}{1L}=5.02584g$
$0.86M$ $NaCl$ solution = $5.0\%w/v$ $NaCl$
