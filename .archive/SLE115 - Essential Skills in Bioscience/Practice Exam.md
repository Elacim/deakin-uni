Use marks to guide you

Sample size (n)
- number
- demographic
- mention where data was gotten from
	- year
Best:
- appropriate sample size?? for what they're analysing
	- Why is it appropriate?
	- Why is it inappropriate (not enough diversity, etc.)
	- importance of large compared to small sample size


Bigger sample size - benefits, why?
- more accurate data
- more representative
Controlling for variables, explain why

Write five statements from the abstract (15-20 marks):
- as if you're writing the abstract FOR the article
- 1 sentence-small paragraph per statement
Intro, results, background, 

How did they do it? - Data collection methods & statistical analysis methods
	Linear regression tests? stuff like that
	On this line, results follow closely, here you can see...
	Central tendencies? Method of analysis, techniques used
What was found
Why is it important

Results
- key findings
- Highest/lowest values, means?
- does it match the findings?
	- Hypothesis confirmed?

Null hyp - no difference in variables, no cause/effect, no change when variables are changed
- opposes hypothesis


Figure legend - must be able to be interpreted without the rest of the article
- title
- what symbols represent
- variables
- how data was obtained
- what type of statistical analysis was used
- general trend
	- highest/lowest point
	- positive/negative

Study design
- minimise alternative interpretations
	- reduce extraneous variables
- only over 65+
- only laboratory tests
- only professional interviews (6-path question adding)
- predefined categories
- if something happens to close, that might be considered as a single event
- using replicates, same stuff (like same amount of water, sunlight, soil type)
