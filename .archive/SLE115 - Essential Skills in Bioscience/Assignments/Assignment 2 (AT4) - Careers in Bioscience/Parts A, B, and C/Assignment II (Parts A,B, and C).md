# Introduction (90 words)
Before discussing my plan A and B, I believe it is a good idea to discuss the fields I am interested in aside from those chosen in A/B. I would love to be a musician, give being a gaffer/a crew member of movies a go, be a film editor and audio mixer, be a part-time journalist, be a microbiologist, be a game developer, be a teacher of Science, be a historian, and be something related to electrical engineering. The chosen jobs are a sort of gross summary of these.

# Part A - Possible career plans
##### Plan A - Soil and Plant Scientist (77 words)
A soil and plant scientist studies the physical and chemical characteristics of soils and their complex ecosystems below our feet to improve agricultural practices, sanctioned human-led environmental projects like mining, and assisting with conservation efforts. Through these studies, the most up-to-date financially and environmentally-friendly methods of performing tasks can be found. Soil scientists also study environments like water where soil interacts, and other related topics regarding how soil affects plant growth and crop yield, and pest management (MBC; n.d.; a). 

##### Plan B - Sound Engineering Technician (71 words)
A sound engineering technician (sound engineer) is involved within all aspects of audio for the benefit of productions involving audio such as film sets, live performance, studio recordings, and radio. This is done by the operation and assembly of audio equipment like mixing boards, rigging up microphones, and digital audio workstations (DAWs) which assist with the recording, amplification, mixing, and general improvements to audio (MBC; n.d. b, O-Net Online; 29 August 2023, and personal knowledge about aspects of audio workflows). 

# Part B - Job report
##### Plan A - Soil and Plant Scientist (297 words)
A Soil and Plant Scientist's day-to-day life involves communication with clients, colleagues, and supervisors about topics such as project developments and research results. It may involve lectures, talks, or workshops with the public or other professionals to inform others about the importance of the line of work and on any developments (MBC; n.d. a).

The basic education required is a Bachelor of Science. There are many entryways into this, some being through specialising in Plant Sciences, Soil Sciences, or Soil Microbiology. It is essential to be able to perform mathematics, have an understanding of when to apply statistical models, solve complex problems, have the ability to teach others concepts, strong decision-making skills, and the ability to take comprehensive notes (MBC; n.d. a). 

Challenges include the writing of detailed, factually accurate reports quickly and efficiently, complex mathematics, a strong and evolving understanding of soil behaviour and ecology, performing daily administrative tasks, and statistical analysis (MBC; n.d. a and O-Net Online; 2023).

I am suited to this job as I have an interest in horticulture, microorganisms, and finding the best conditions for plant growth. I believe I have a relatively strong attention to detail, a willingness to learn new ideas, and the ability to teach concepts which would translate well to being a Soil and Plant scientist, which I believe my future Bachelor of Science will further enhance. I also love to research topics and perform experiments, especially out in the field.

EcOZ Environmental Services (2020) perform lots of services such as conducting environmental impact reports, constructing rehabilitation plans suited to the given regions, initial studies of water and land and the organisms within, and "threatened species assessments and monitoring". JBS&G (n.d.) also provide similar services, as well as other like environmental asbestos assessments. Both of these would be choice employers that are both relevant to the field and allow skill improvement.

##### Plan B - Sound Engineering Technician (287 words)
Depending on the role, a sound engineering technician's day-to-day activities may involve rigging up microphones and speakers, recording audio and finding the best positions for microphones, emailing colleagues and clients about production requirements and issues, using audio equipment like mixers to record, and adjust volume levels during live performances and recordings (O-Net Online; 2023 a and MBC; n.d. b)

Qualifications are not strictly necessary, but experience is highly preferred (O-Net Online; 2023) and a a degree like a Bachelor of Arts specialising in music could assist greatly. This job requires the ability to solve complex problems, work with others to find the best solutions, critical thinking abilities, strong time management skills, and learning from experience (MBC; n.d. b)

Challenges include frequent interpersonal communication with clients, working with complex technology, the ability to work under extreme pressure, the ability to follow cues, and staying up-to-date with evolving technology and techniques (MBC; n.d. b).

I have a keen interest in audio as a hobbyist musician, where I do my own mixing and find the best ways to get audio to sound the best it can. I love problem solving and getting my hands dirty with cable management and the eustress from live performances. The job would let me flourish in those ways. 

A potential employers could be Bolinda (2023), a Perth-based organisation specialising in audiobooks. A sound engineer there would be responsible for the recording and mixing of audiobooks, organisation of people for recording sessions, and communicate with colleagues, clients, and with supervisors. This would provide excellent experience for recording in quieter settings. Another option is Melbourne-based Studio Truth (n.d.), a recording studio for musicians that helps records, fully mixes, and masters the finished tracks. Through the work, I would gain an understanding of industry practices and be able to apply them to my own music.

# Part C - Identifying skills/training
##### Plan A - Soil and Plant Scientist (195 words)
- Specialist skills and training
To work in this field, learning industry-specific software like Autodesk AutoCAD, ERSI ArcGIS software, GSLIB, STATISTICA, Leica Geosystems ERDAS IMAGINE, and the ability to program with R is valuable and can be necessary for a job. More generalised skills like Microsoft Office application aptitude are necessary (O-Net Online; 2023b).

There are many possible routes for specialist training (MBC; n.d. a). A Science-related bachelor is the bare minimum to obtain a job. A Bachelor of Agricultural Sciences such as the one offered by LaTrobe University would be necessary for a job in agricultural assistance (Course Seeker; 2023). For soil-specific information, a Cert III of Horticulture leading into a Diploma like the one offered by TAFE NSW (2023) would be excellent for less skilled work in the field.

The Conservation Volunteers Australia organisation (CVA) (2023) has a volunteering position to assist with tasks such as the collection and propagation of native seeds, revegetation efforts, and weeding to improve native plant health. There are many other opportunities found through the CVA that would increase my aptitude. A position tying in research, conservation, and journalism would gel well with my interests like as found by the Adelaide Park Lands Association Inc (n.d.). GoVolunteer (2023a) has many opportunities too.

##### Plan B - Sound Engineering Technician (197 words)
A sound engineer must be able to do many different practical tasks and have the appropriate theory memorised to perform their job best. A Cert IV in Music/Sound production teaching the basics like mixing, and recording live audio would provide an excellent base and allow for an easier experience moving into more privileged positions (Box Hill Institute; 2023). A less traditional option would be to go through courses on sound design found on sites like YouTube by creators like Charley Sauret (2022).

Understanding the science behind acoustics through specialisation into sound physics could prove helpful. A major part of sound engineering is finding the best ways to minimise environmental interference and unwanted noise, so training, research, and personal experimentation would be necessary. For recording music, basic musical knowledge such as understanding tempo and metre is a must (Indeed; 2023 and O-Net Online; 2023 a). 

In regards to volunteering opportunities, I have heard, from personal knowledge, about people asking the managers to intern at pubs or clubs that have performances on to gain experience. The radio station 103.5FM, also known as 3MBS, has volunteering positions for sound engineers and audio recording (3MBS; n.d.). GoVolunteer (2023b) has opportunities too, though these need more experience and/or qualifications than I have at the present.
