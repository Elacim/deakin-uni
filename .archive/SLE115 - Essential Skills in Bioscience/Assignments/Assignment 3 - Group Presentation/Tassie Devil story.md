What is the Tassie Devil? Common areas/locations to find the devil. 
What is DFTD? When was it found (suspected to be 1986 according to wikipedia)
Where does dftd show on the devil’s body?

Topic 1 - DFTD: Mirella
Transmission (food, sexual contact - mating rituals?, is it interspecies?, is it only biting?)
Types (DFT1 and DFT2), human connection
The consequences of DFTD (tumours, decimated population…)

Topic 2 - Preventions, treatments, and cures (what has been tried, what hasn’t worked): Sue
Limitations
Prevention strategies
Experiments done (phylodynamics)

Topic 3 - External factors: (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6927850/) - Ethan
Geography, devil abundance, and food availability  (subheading “Monitoring the spread of DFTD”, para. 4)
Monitoring difficulties (not finding any infected devils in suspected regions, difficulty in diagnosing tumours as misc. wounds look similar)
The public is helping report (“Reports to the STDP through roadkill sightings or the hotline used by the general public have proved effective”)
Motion sensing cameras

The year is 1986. Tasmania (insert a location where they're found). A Tasmanian devil organises a rendezvous with it's friend:
 D1: "I have these small lumps" (describe the lump appearance, all the locations it can be).
 D2: Was it something you ate? Did you catch it from someone?
 D1: It could have been something I ate... and Stacey bit me the other day in a mating ritual  ( I want you by The Beatles)
 D2: You need to go talk to Stacey immediately
 -> Romeo and Juliet? 
 
 :: Stacey's Crib (Tassie Devil den) :: - set the scene (whats in it etc.)
D1: Stacey... I need to talk with you about <stacey cuts them off>
Stacey: Oh my god, D1! What happened to you?!
D1: That's what I needed to talk to you about... Did you cause this?
Stacey: W-what? How would I do that?
Stacey and D1 discuss stuff, related to topic 1. Loose talk about prevention strategies. They attempt some cures.
They come to the conclusion that the hospital is the right way to go.

:: Tasmanian devil hospital - TOPIC 2 ::
Doctor is a wombat 
D2: Doctor? How long do they have left to live? 
Doctor: I suspect it is anywhere between a few months to a few years. Given time and genetic changes, we will become naturally more resilient to DFTD and live longer.
D2: Is there any immediate solutions?
Doctor: Stop biting each other while mating. 
Back and forth on limitations, prevention strats, experiments done

:: Bush (location where they're found) ::
Human: There's another one here... we didn't even see this one in the cameras setup around. How are we supposed to keep up with the disease when we can't track them?
Human 2: ...I found one! Nevermind, it looks like it died in a fight, not by the disease. They look so similar, don't they?

D1 didn't live much longer.. and he never found what caused his illness. Some freak genetic mutation? Was he the first? 
:: D1's Funeral :: 
Eulogiser (Stacey): D1 was a fantastic friend, colleague, and lover. They should have lived a full 5 year life (8 in captivity) but they were taken away too soon by a terrible disease. Malformed but content. Broken but unwavering. Crippled but walking miles in our paws.

:: Bush ::
Stacey found sick in the bush. Showing symptoms of DFTD (coughing?). Presumed dead.
Stacey had a child by the way.

:: Fast forward to 2014 (from 1986) :: 
Stacey's great-great-grandchild has developed the first recorded case of DFT2
