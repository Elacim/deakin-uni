# Part B
## Introduction
###### General statement(s)
- Fossil fuels, unstoppable since the Industrial Revolution
	- Double-edged sword (technological progression vs climate change)
- Continuous research into less-damaging competitive alternatives 
- (The National Academy of Sciences and The Royal Society, 2020:5).

###### Specific topic
- Attempts with large-scale funding into algal biofuels since the 1970s (Westervelt A; 2023)
- Essay will discuss the current status, new technologies, and challenges 
	- Even with higher consumption rates (Prabu A et. al; 2018), will they be a fossil fuel competitor?

###### Thesis statement
Algal-based biofuels have an arduous, but attainable path to gain feasibility as a non-competitive cohabitant with fossil fuels. 

###### Outline
**Topic 1:** Positive and negative factors enhancing growth and output
**Topic 2**: Technologies are being developed constantly
**Topic 3:** Challenges involved with scaling up algae-biofuel production

## Body
###### Topic 1 - Positive and negative factors enhancing growth and output
- Enhancing lipid yield (Behera B *et. al*; 2021:3.2):
		- environmental stress; nitrogen/phosphorus starvation, lower light energy and enough throughout the day, light frequencies affect quality.
- Biological harmers:
	- disease/fungi (Miyasato E M and Cardinale B J; 2023)
	- microscopic grazers (Day J G et. al; 2017)
- Light:
	- Differing frequencies, intensities, amounts throughout the day or in sequences
		- Better algal biomass or lipid production through lesser or greater intensities of light respectively (Maltsev Y et. al; 2021)
	- Challenges come in with different algal species/strains (Maltsev Y et. al; 2021)
		- Three species within the same genus exposed to the same frequency and power of light have a 4% range of lipid counts (Behera B *et. al*; 2021:3.2)

###### Topic 2 - Technologies are being developed constantly
- Hydrothermal liquefaction (Bagchi S L et. al; 2021):
	- Converts from wet>oil instead of wet>dry>oil.
	- Skips drying which is ~30% of total costs.
- Fossil fuel waste products:
	- Could be used on the goal to a society that primarily uses renewable energies.
		- Coal seam gas water treated (small quantity of acetic acid) -> allowing a part of 300 gigalitres/y to be recovered (Hamawand I et. al; 2014:para 2).
	- Flue gas and wastewater:
		- use of captured smoke stack exhaust to provide foundation for microalgal growth (Kothari R *et. al*; 2021).
- Genetic engineering (Behera B et. al; 2021:4.2):
	- CRISPR -> lipid yield and quality -> compatible algal species (*C. reinhardtii*) can be increased, increasing biofuel quantities 
	- Altering metabolic pathways can enhance fatty acid production (Yaashikaa P R et. al; 2022)

###### Topic 3 - Challenges involved with scaling up algae-biofuel production
- Resource-intensive usage issues (Bošnjaković M and Sinaga N; 2020:3.2):
	- Primarily drying power usage
	- water usage (90% recyclable)
	- When chemicals are used, large amounts are needed and energy for removal before biofuel conversion
- For lab to commercial quantities - reasonable price of production; utilised resources within available national amounts (Davis R E et. al; 2014)
	- Technologies are underdeveloped; not primed for commercial quantities (Bošnjaković M and Sinaga N; 2020:3.2)
- Big oil, has stopped providing funds
	- The last organisation (ExxonMobil) funding research stopped funding. (Westervelt A; 2023:para.1)
	- Research needs "several billion\[s]" of funding and persistence (Westervelt A; 2023:para.5)

## Conclusion 
###### Thesis restatement
- Algae-biofuel research has come a long way but with more research and time, they could be a cohabitant with fossil fuels.
###### Main point summary
- Factors affecting growth include light intensity, frequency, and quantity, nitrogen and phosphorus levels, stress, disease, fungi, and grazers. Knowledge is the first step.
- Technologies like gene-editing using CRISPR, hydrothermal liquefaction, and the treatment of wastewater signify potential.
- Issues with producing algae-biofuel (resource usage factors, energy, and economic factors -> signify hardship.
