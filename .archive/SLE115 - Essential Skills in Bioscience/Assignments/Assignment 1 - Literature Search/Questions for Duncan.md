With in-text referencing, can I instead use a numbered system like \[1], \[2]. 
	If not, can I use regular in-text citations in conjunction with a numbered system, like "\[1] (Day J G, Gong Y, Hu Q; 2017)"?
		Helps with readability and finding references later on

Can I submit an assignment in markdown format?
	It's easiest for my current setup
	It can be opened with any browser/text editor

Am I allowed to use footnotes? I desperately want to use footnotes

Can you help me find what's wrong with my wording? I can tell something is a bit wrong and while I have some ideas, I don't know exactly what it is nor how to fix it. The sentences theoretically make sense but have no solid structure, they feel fluid with grammar.
	- clunky wording
	- poor grammar
	- trying to stuff as much inside a sentence as possible

### Referencing: 
Should I do:
- (Maltsev Y, Maltseva K, Kulikovskiy M, and Maltseva S; 2021)
or
- (Maltsev Y, Maltseva K, Kulikovskiy M and Maltseva S 2021)
	- (no oxford comma or semicolon separating year)
How about:
- (Matsev Y et. al; 2021)
	- should this be 'et al.'-ified?

In-text:
- (Miyasato E M and Cardinale B J; 2023; Behera B *et. al*; 2021:3.2)
How do I format multiple authors while keeping the date semicolon'd away?
I think a line/pipe (|) would be ideal 
- (Miyasato E M and Cardinale B J; 2023 | Behera B *et. al*; 2021:3.2)
