#### From the Week 2 pdf
Introduction:
	What is muscle damage and wastage?
	What is creatine?
	Thesis statement 

Body 1 - creatine can prevent protein breakdown
	- creatine -> muscle degradation is prevented
	- in damaged muscle cells, it prevented degradation and increased protein synth by 80% 
	- It upregulates key growth factors such as IGF-4 (protects against muscle wastage)

Body 2 - do these properties work when it's supplemented?
	- long term usage renders creatine ineffecive
	- for short periods, it's effecive
	- after muscle injuries, similar recovery times w/ and w/o creatine 

Conclusion - summary & restatement of POV
	- shown to have protective properties against muscle damamge & wasting
		- effects do not last long enoguh for it to be a protective measure
	- more research needed to discover alt. ways it can be protected
