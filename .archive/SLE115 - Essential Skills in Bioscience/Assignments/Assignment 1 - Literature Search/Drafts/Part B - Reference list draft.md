# Questions
Should DOIs omit the 'https://www.doi.org' stuff?
Are semicolons allowed inbetween sections? It looks so much better

-> 30% of cell weight is lipids; algae provides a carbon sink ($CO_{2}\xrightarrow{photosynthesis}O_{2}$); diatoms are an option - silicate cell walls; water can be reused; waste products like protein-rich biomass and glycerol can be reused in other industries (animal feed and other assorted jobs)
