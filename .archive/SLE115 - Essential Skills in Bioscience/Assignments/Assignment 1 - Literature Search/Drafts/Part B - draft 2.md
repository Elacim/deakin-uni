# Introduction
###### General statement(s)
Energy-dense fossil fuels have long been an unstoppable force since the Industrial Revolution, seeming to provide humanity with endless technological progression with no end in sight. It is more a double-edged sword, as it is the leading cause of climate change due to the harmful greenhouse gas emissions when utilised in power generation. Due to this fact, there has been continuous research into finding less damaging and still competitive alternatives to fossil fuels (The National Academy of Sciences and The Royal Society, 2020:5).

###### Specific topic
Methods of making algal-based biofuels a feasible competitive cohabitant of fossil fuels with large amounts of funding, have been propositioned and researched since the 1970s (Westervelt A, 2023). This essay will discuss the current status, new technologies, and challenges of algal biofuels and discuss if, with their similar productivity levels but higher consumption rates, they will be a fossil fuel competitor and a part of every day life (Prabu A, Venkatramanan M, Jayaprabakar J; 2018).

###### Thesis statement
Algal-based biofuels have an arduous, but attainable path to gain feasibility as a non-competitive cohabitant with fossil fuels.

**Topic 2**: Technologies are being developed constantly
**Topic 3:** Challenges involved with scaling up algae-biofuel production

# Body
###### Topic 1 - Positive and negative factors enhancing growth and output
- Enhancing lipid yield (Behera B *et. al*; 2021:3.2):
		- environmental stress helps, nitrogen and phosphorus starvation, lower light energy and not too much throughout the day, quality depends on light frequencies.
	- Cursory talk about using genetic engineering to increase algal metabolic efficiency (in-depth in topic 3) (Yaashikaa P R et. al; 2022)
- Biological harmers:
	- disease/fungi (Miyasato E M and Cardinale B J; 2023)
	- microscopic grazers (Day J G et. al; 2017)
- Light:
	- Differing frequencies, intensities, amounts throughout the day or in sequences
		- can optimise for algal biomass or lipid production through lesser or greater intensities of light respectively (Maltsev Y et. al; 2021)
	- Challenges come in with different algal species/strains (Maltsev Y et. al; 2021)
		- Three species within the same genus like *N. Oceania, N. Oculata,* and *N. Salina* exposed to the same frequency and power of light and growing regime have a 4% range of lipid counts (Behera B *et. al*; 2021:3.2)

###### Topic 2 - Technologies are being developed constantly
- Hydrothermal liquefaction (Bagchi S L et. al; 2021):
	- Converts from wet>oil instead of wet>dry>oil.
	- Skips drying step which is $\approx$ 30% of total costs.
- Waste products from fossil fuel:
	- Could be used on the goal to a society that primarily uses renewable energies.
	  - Coal seam gas obtained via fracking (DES; 2023).
		- Potential to grow algae in CSG water treated with a small quantity of acetic acid, allowing a part of 300 gigalitres/y to be recovered (Hamawand I et. al; 2014:para 2).
	- Flue gas and wastewater:
		- use of captured smoke stack exhaust to provide foundation for microalgal growth (Kothari R *et. al*; 2021).
- Genetic engineering (Behera B et. al; 2021:4.2):
	- Via gene editing techniques like CRISPR, the lipid yield and quality of a compatible algal species like *C. reinhardtii* can be increased, therefore increasing biofuel quantities purely from human-led genetic interference. 
	- Altering metabolic pathways, such as adding more genes related to producing the thioesterase enzyme, allowing a negative feedback loop to continue, enhancing fatty acid production (Yaashikaa P R et. al; 2022)

###### Topic 3 - Challenges involved with scaling up algae-biofuel production
- Resource-intensive usage issues:
	- Primarily drying power usage, water usage (though with a 90% recycle rate), and when chemicals are used, there are large amounts needed and energy is needed to remove them before the conversion to biofuel (Bošnjaković M and Sinaga N; 2020:3.2)
- Shifting from lab to commercial quantities, a reasonable price of production must be reached and the resources utilised must be within the available national amounts (Davis R E et. al; 2014)
	- many technologies are still being developed and are not primed for commercial quantities (Bošnjaković M and Sinaga N; 2020:3.2)
- A major source of funding for research, big oil, has all but stopped providing funds
	- The last organisation (ExxonMobil) funding algal-biofuel research in Big Oil just stopped funding. (Westervelt A; 2023:para.1)
	- Research needs "several billion\[s]" of funding and persistence (Westervelt A; 2023:para.5)
	- Liquid fuels may not be the future due to the shift to electric transportation (Westervelt A; 2023:para.19)

# Conclusion 
###### Thesis restatement
Algal-biofuel research has come a long way throughout the decades and with more research and time, will continue to develop and be honed in to reach a point where it can be a lesser coexisting force with fossil fuels. 
###### Main point summary
- Factors affecting growth include light intensity, frequency, and quantity, nitrogen and phosphorus levels, stress, disease, fungi, and grazers.
- Technologies like gene-editing using CRISPR, hydrothermal liquefaction, and the treatment of wastewater leave a promising path ahead
- Issues with producing algae-biofuel touch resource usage factors, energy, and economic factors, creating complex decisions moving forward
Algal-biofuels have critical issues that need to be resolved before they become a reality, but the
