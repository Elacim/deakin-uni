Only a few decades ago there were two schools of thought about the origin of lunar craters such as Crater Tycho and Crater Copernicus.
Many astronomers believed them to be of internal origin, that is to say volcanic – quite different from our own towering volcanoes such as Vesuvius, and more akin to caldera such as those found in Hawaii. The rival theory attributed them to meteorite impacts.
I was a strong supporter of the volcanic theory, but the evidence against it built up until even diehards like myself had no choice but to admit that it was wrong.
As the Moon – like Earth – is under constant bombardment from meteoritic debris, small impact craters may be produced at times (a few have certainly been identified on Mars), but the chances of a strike by an impactor massive enough to produce any significant volcanism are low. I think we can safely rule out any sizeable crater being formed by internal action, both on the Moon and here.

- upto a few decades ago
- Astronomers thought lunar craters were due to volcanoes -> of the caldera type
- The new leading theory is meteorite impacts
- The volcano theory was upheld by "diehards like" Author Patrick Moore
- "seems definite" moon was formed 4.6 billion years ago between old Earth and an ancient celestial body the size of Mars
- much like a separatory funnel, melting outer layers separated into less dense rising and staying up on the surface to form a crust and the denser material travelling down hundreds of kilometres down

The "volcanic theory" of how caldera-like craters on the Moon were formed has been upheld by "diehards like" Author Patrick Moore (2023), being contested by the alternate theory claiming that the Moon's craters were formed by meteoric impacts. Moore now attests that the most realistic theory is that small meteorites have caused insignificant amounts of lunar volcanic activity and therefore few volcano-related craters while the most "sizeable" of the Moon's craters resulted from large meteoric debris.

Note: This doesn't exactly coincide with the point of the article. I'm attempting to paraphrase this small section, not the entire (incredibly interesting) article.
