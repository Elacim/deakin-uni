### Abstract
Large animals have a much better fuel economy than small ones, both when they rest and when they run. At rest, each gram of tissue of the largest land animal, the African elephant, consumes metabolic energy at 1/20 the rate of a mouse; using existing allometric relationships, we calculate that it should be able to carry 1 g of its tissue (or a load) for 1 km at 1/40 the cost for a mouse. These relationships between energetics and size are so consistent that they have been characterized as biological laws. The elephant has massive legs and lumbers along awkwardly, suggesting that it might expend more energy to move about than other
animals. We find, however, that its energetic cost of locomotion is predicted remarkably well by the allometric relationships and is the lowest recorded for any living land animal.

**What did they study?**
Elephant metabolic energy usage (fuel economy) compared to other animals

**How did they study it?**
This abstract is not very informative on methodology but here's an attempt:
Using Douglas bags. Calculating the energy usage of carrying 1g of tissue for 1km. Finding the allometric relationships. 

**What is/are the major findings of the study?**
That large animals like elephants require significantly less energy per gram of tissue moved/km. They fit the allometric trend.

### Introduction
<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">African elephants are the largest living land animals; a large adult male weighs as much as 6000 kg (six metric tonnes). They are the classic example of a graviportal animal, possessing massive pillar-like legs for supporting their weight (Gray, 1968). They walk or amble rather than run. At a fast walk, the strains in their limb bones reach levels similar to those in a horse at a fast gallop, with a similar safety factor to failure (Alexander et al. 1979; Biewener and Taylor, 1986).

Fuel economy normally improves with increasing size. The metabolic energy cost of moving each kilogram over 1 m decreases with body mass to the power -0.316 (Taylor et al. 1982) and, on the basis of its size, the elephant ought to be the most fuel-efficient living land animal. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">However, we felt that it might pay an energetic price for its massive legs and lumbering gait.</mark> Functional anatomists have argued convincingly that cursorial animals are efficient runners with limbs designed for running economically (Howell, 1944), while graviportal animals are at the opposite end of the continuum of limb design. It takes energy to accelerate and decelerate the limbs alternately during each stride and, although the amount is small in walking humans (Cavagna and Kanekeo, 1977) and in most birds and mammals at walking speeds (Fedak et al. 1982), the moments of inertia of an elephant leg are orders of magnitude greater. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Swinging its limbs could involve a substantial cost and, if so, the elephant will be an exception to the allometric rule.</mark>

Elephants are not sedentary animals, and there are clear ecological advantages and selection pressures for a high fuel economy. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">They travel long distances (483–644 km; 300–400 miles) during their seasonal migrations (Sikes, 1971) and may sustain a constant speed for 3–4 h at a time, covering up to 16 km (Guy, 1976). </mark>It would clearly be advantageous for them to move cheaply. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">We measured the energetics of walking elephants to determine whether they moved as cheaply as predicted by the allometric relationship (Taylor et al. 1982) o<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">r whether they paid an energetic price for their massive legs and lumbering gait.</mark></mark>

### Methods
Explain the experimental protocol in this study, using 4-5 dot points to explain the protocol
- Train 3 elephants to wear a oxygen mask and follow a golf cart
- Pump air through at 100$L/s^{-1}$ while the elephant walks at a constant speed for 10 minutes on a flat circuit
- After 7 minutes, measure the flow for 3 minutes using a 2001 Douglas bag and analyse the oxygen concentration with a paramagenetic oxygen analyser
- Calibrate using nitrogen to obtain at $\pm$ 2% accuracy
- Calculate energy expenditure - TCOT and NCOT

What is the sample size (n value) in this study?
3 elephants

Do you think it is a reasonable n value?
No. Three is just about the bare minimum. Elephants are hard to obtain though. 

What statistical analysis was used?
Unspecified. Likely linear regression.

- Brief description of the trend

Our attempt:
The speed (m s^-1) was plotted against the net cost of transport (J kg m) for three young African Elephants compared to humans through the use of oxygen masks. Both humans and elephants display an upwards curvelinear trend towards expending more energy for speed increases. The data was found by dividing the mass-specific metabolic rate by the speed of the subject.

Fixed attempt:
**Title:** Fig 3. Net energetics - elephant vs. human
**Variables:** Speed/cost of transport
**Groups:** Human (Margaria, 1938) and Elephants
**Sample size (n):** 3
**Description:** Different shapes = different individuals
**How we got the results:** Collected expelled air after walking for 10 minutes to calculate net cost
**General trend:** As transport cost goes up, speed increases, curvilinearly


Title: Blood alcohol concentration in males and females
Variables: Blood alcohol concentration (BAC mL/L) and time (minutes)
Groups: Females and males
Sample Size: Male (15) and Female (20) - 35 total
Description: Male - orange; Female - blue
How we got the results: Measuring BAC in 30 minute intervals over 2 hours. The average for each time and sex were graphed
General trend: Male - increased until 90 minutes before dropping; Females - steady positive linear increase. Significant difference between males and females at the 60/90/120 minute intervals
