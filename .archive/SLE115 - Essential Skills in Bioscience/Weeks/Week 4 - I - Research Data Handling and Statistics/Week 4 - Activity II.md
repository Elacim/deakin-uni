	- families may feel inadequate as parents if they bottle fed
	- there are a lot of factors that can affect cholesterol - genetics especially

	4. more regular follow ups
2. Are there limitations to good experimental design when working with humans? Why?
	- genetic variance
	- differing diets
	- cultural differences

	- extraneous variables 
	- self-reporting bias
