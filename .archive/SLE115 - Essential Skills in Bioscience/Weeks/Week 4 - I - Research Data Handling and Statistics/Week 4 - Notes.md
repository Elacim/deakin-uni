Why collect data?
- investigating phenomena
- propose models of understanding
- evidence-based judgements
- informed management decisions
- new inventions/therapies/discoveries - the greater good
- enhances critical thinking

Stats can be:
- how you handle, present, and manipulate data	
 - usually quantitative information
 - methods of handling quantitative info
They help us make comparisons, inferences, or generalisations
Useful for:
	- reading and evaluating published scientific studies (journal articles)
	- undertaking own investigations and present data correctly
Initial rejections/conditional acceptance - usually because of incorrect statistic analysis/sample size
	- Exactly why peer-reviewed articles are best

They do not 'prove' anything, only provide support. Using inaccurate data will give inaccurate results.

Observations -> Models -> Hypothesis -> Null hypothesis -> Experiment -> Interpretation -> Restart from 1-3
You either reject or accept the hypothesis. It should be a continuous loop of discovery.
Null hypothesis - nothing happens. Test it to see if there is a significant difference. You can't fully accept a null hypothesis - there's always room for error/alt interpretation

You must be able to test your null hypothesis ($H_{0}$) 
e.g. - 'The presence of wind turbines does not increase mortality rates of migratory birds' is not specific enough. Something like 'The presence of wind turbines in Portland, Victoria does not increase mortality rates of seagulls'
	- no not really, it's 1:14,275
You write both a null and 1+ hypotheses

###### What to think about:
Climate change impact on alpine flora
	- trees, bushes, flowering plants?
		- used for nesting?
	- height, number, presence/absence?
	- Historical materials
	- Soil, now, animal impacts?
	- Resources like time and money
	- Long-term or short-term study
	- How to interpret results and if there should be follow up studies

Growing plants - size, health, and age have to be identical. Fertiliser is the independent variable, plant growth is the dependent variable

###### Desirable properties of hypotheses
1. Empirical - susceptible to observation
2. Generality - should account for general phenomena, not a single occurence
3. Plausible - doesn't defy logic
4. Specific - concept used should be clearly defined
5. Testable - the hypothesis must be testable (no tautology/theoretical concept - 'heads I win, tails you lose')

##### Variables
- scientific studies look at and deal with variables
	- differences between individuals in a population
	- property of interest may take on different values (e.g. height; weight; age; or morbidity)
	- expressed in appropriate units
- Dependent variable (DV)
	- variable we hypothesise will alter as a consequence of manipulation - on the y-axis 
	- thing you are measuring
	 - 'responding variable '
- Independent variable (IV)
	- variable we manipulate in an experiment; controlled by researcher - on x-axis
	- 'manipulated variable' or 'cause'. The 'if' part.
	- thing you are testing
- Extraneous variables
	- any other factors that can affect the relationship between the independent and dependent variables
	- must be controlled or reduced as much as possible
		- working in a lab allows conditions to be controlled 

# Examples
People taking aspirin will get pain relief than those without
	IV: Aspirin
	DV: Pain relief

Plant growth w/ fertiliser
	IV: Fertiliser amounts
	DV: Plant growth

Birds mortality, wind turbines
	IV: Location
	DV: Bird death

Brand name vs generic:
	IV: Brand name lightbulb
	DV: Light bulb length of time before burning out

# Hypothesis testing, sample size
Population
- In stats, all individual items that could be studied
- Individuals/all individuals
- studying every single member is difficult
- Take a sample - part of population


##### Sample
- Inferences about total population
- Bigger is better to demonstrate effects that are representative of the population
	- suitable representation
	- if effect on a population and the sample size is too small, a real effect may not be detected
- Cost effective and relevant
- Experimental design 

**Systematic**
	- being at random point, collect at regular intervals
		- e.g. every 3rd person
		- e.g. every 6 hours, take measurements
	- may be biased (chosen times)
	- fine if said clearly and appropriately chosen

**Simple random sampling**
- each member has an equal probability to be selected
- sample is generally more representative of population
- assumed by all statistical tests
- avoids observer bias

**Stratified random**
- population is divided into groups based on a characteristic
	- such as height, weight, species

##### Experimental design 
- data collection must take into account variability that occurs naturally
	- Can't be eliminated by proper design can avoid biases
- Correlation $\neq$ causation
	- Cause-effect
	- Confounded variable
	- Coincidence
- State hypothesis 
	- Question(s) asking
	- Restate each question as a hypothesis (null hypothesis)
		- Sunflower rotates with the Sun
		- Null: Sunflower is not linked to Sun
	- Be clear in what you're answering
- Control groups
	- Positive (e.g. ) and negative (e.g. no creatin added)
	- Placebo groups/base line measurements
- Test sampling design through preliminary sampling
- Verify sampling - test design in range of conditions (e.g. different areas of world)
- Post- and pre-treatment studies

###### Replication
- refers to sample size
- repetition of experiment/treatment on more than one subject/unit
	- treatment is what is being done to the subject/unit
	- replicate samples
- Technical replication - one unit with multiple tests (e.g. 1 sample/10 minutes)
- Biological - multiple units with one tests

###### Determining sample size
How precise?
	Very -> Large sample size
	Fairly -> Small
How sure?
	Very -> large
	Fairly -> Small
Variation in population?
	High -> Large
	Low -> Small

###### Adherence to design 
- Unexpected results - do not abandon method
	- Publish paper
- If well designed, planned, and executed well, unexpected/undesirable results are probably true
