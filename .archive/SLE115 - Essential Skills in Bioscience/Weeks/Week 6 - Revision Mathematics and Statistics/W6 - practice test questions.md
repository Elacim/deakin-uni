$\frac{1.25 \times 10^{4}}{250m^{2}}=50$ trees

### Q2
Sample = 450g. After drying in an oven for 2 days, the now dry sample weighed 270g. What was the % of water before drying?
$450-270=180; \frac{180}{450}=0.4=40\%$ water

### Q4
###### a)
Convert 0.032 to a percentage
$0.032 \times 100=3.2\%$

Two 100m^2 quadrants. Weeds for 2 quads was $\frac{3}{4}$ and $\frac{3}{8}$ of the quadrant. What fraction of the 200m^2 was covered by weeds?
$100 \times (1 - \frac{3}{4}) = 25$ and $100m^{2} \times (1 - \frac{3}{8})=62.5$
$25+62.5=87.5m^{2}; \frac{87.5m^{2}}{200m^{2}}$

### Q7
$1cm^{3}$ of soil holds 1,200 cells of blue-green algae, how many cells in $6.5 \times 10^{2}$ $cm^{3}$ of soil?
$1cm^{3} = 1.2 \times 10^{2}$
$(1.2 \times 10^{2}) \times (6.5 \times 10^{2})$
$1.2 \times 6.5 = 7.8$
$10^{2} \times 10^{2}=10^{4}$
$\rightarrow 7.8 \times 10^{4}$

### Q8
63.25g of $NaCl$ dissolved in 12.2L of water. What is the concentration of salt?
salt:water ratio (salt $\div$ water)
$\frac{63.25g}{12.2L}=5.9g/L$

NOT THIS: $\frac{63.25}{1000}=0.06325=6.325 \times 10^{-2}$; $(6.325 \times 10^{-2})(1.22 \times 10^{2})$


### Q9
Eucalyptus planted as a seedling grew to 300mm after 1 year. 2 years later, it was 600mm
###### a) Format into y=mx+c
$y=300x$

###### b) How high when it was first planted?
$y=300(0)=0 \text{mm}$ tall


### Q10
###### a) 
0.00725mm = ? $\micro$m
$10^{-3} \rightarrow 10^{-6}$ (3 non-sig figs, so it's more like -6 to -6)
$7.25 \times 10^{-6} \micro$m

###### b)
16kg = ? ng (nanograms)
$10^3 \rightarrow 10^{-9}$
-9 - 3 = -12, -12 \* 1000 = -12,000
$16 \times 12,000=192000$ng
$=1.92 \times 10^{3}$ng
$1.6 \times 10^{4}\rightarrow 1.6 \times 10^{-9}$


### Q11
Choose all the correct statements about pH
$a, b, e$


### Q12 
RBC count in a $30 \micro m \times 50\micro m$. Area in standard form (m$^{2}$)?
Area = $30 \times 50=1500 \micro m = 1.5 \times 10^{-3} \micro m$

Micrometres -> metres = $x \times 10^{-3}m$
Compared to metres, micrometres are 1e+6
Metre -> micrometre = 1e+6
Micrometre -> metre = 1e-6

$\micro$ = 0.000001/m (1e-6)
$mm$ = 0.001/m (1e-3)
$cm$ = 0.01/m (1e-2)
deci = 0.1/m (1e-1)
$m$ = 1/1m

-> milli: $1.5 \times 10^{-6}$
-> centi: $1.5 \times 10^{-9}$
-> metres: $1.5 \times 10^{-12}$

$30 \times 10^{-6}$


### Q13
Largest to smallest
c. Gram -> milligram -> microgram -> nanogram

### Q14
Action potentials in digestive tract -> unmyelinated at 7m/s, myelinated at 120m/s
###### a) How long when unmyelinated for a distance of 0.5m?
$7/$
After 7m, 1 second will have passed
After 0.5m, x seconds will have passed
$d=$distance; $t=$time; $s=$speed
$s \times t = d$
-> $t=\frac{d}{s}$
-> $t=\frac{0.5m}{7m/s}$
	-> $t=0.0714285714 = 7.1 \times 10^{-2}$ seconds
	-> 71.4 ms
###### b) How long when myelinated for a distance of 0.5m?
$t=\frac{0.5m}{120m/s}$
-> $t=0.0041666667$
	-> $t=4.2 \times 10^{-3}$
	-> 4.2ms (0.004s)

###### c) How much faster is myelinated compared to unmyelinated?
$\frac{71.4ms}{33.3ms} \times 100=214.41\%$ faster
$120-7=113m/s$ -> $\frac{113}{7}=16.14 \rightarrow 1614\%$ faster

###### d) Assume two synapses in the 0.5m nerve. 1ms delay/synapse. How long when myelinated for 0.5m?
$0.004s + (0.0001ms \times 2 \text{ synapses})=0.006s$

# Q19
Need a final volume of 500mL containing 50mM of glucose. How much glucose (180u) in grams?
0.050M of glucose -> 
$C_1V_1=C_2V_2$ (no not this)

final vol \* glucose molarity
$n=0.5L \times 0.05M=0.025$ mol of glucose
mol of glucose \* it's molecular weight
$m=0.025 \times 180u=4.5$ grams of glucose

# Q20 
Using a 50% glucose stock solution - what volume is needed to make 50ml of a 5% glucose solution?
$C_1V_1=C_2V_2$
$50mL \times V_{1} = 5mL \times 0.05L$
$V_{1} = \frac{5mL \times 0.05L}{50 mL}=5 \times 10^{-3}L = 5mL$
