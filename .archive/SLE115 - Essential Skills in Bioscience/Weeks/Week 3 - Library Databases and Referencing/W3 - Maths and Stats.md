Median - even number, take two central numbers and average them

[Standard Deviation](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/nichsr/stats_tutorial/section2/mod8_sd.html) - A standard deviation (or Ïƒ) is **a measure of how dispersed the data is in relation to the mean**. Low standard deviation means data are clustered around the mean, and high standard deviation indicates data are more spread out.
$\sigma$ is best used when the data approximates a bell curve
$-3\sigma$ and $+3 \sigma$  indicate the data is unusual and that some of the data points were far from the mean - known as being 'statistically significant'
Low values indicate it is within 'expected variance'

$\pm1\sigma$ - 68% of data
$\pm2\sigma$ - 95% of data
$\pm3\sigma$ - 98% of data


$\sigma=\sqrt \frac{\sum|x_i-a|}{5}$

$a$ = average of data set
$p_{x}$ = point in data set
$n$ = data set size

($p_{x}$ - $a$)$^2$ + ().. + ()..
divided by $n$ = $\sigma^{2}=$ variance

Standard deviation = $\sqrt{\frac{\sigma{^2}}{n}}$

Standard Error of the Mean / The Standard Error (SEM) = $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt n}$
SEM gets the standard deviation of all the averages of multiple data sets (though it also be used on only one set) - means of the means



Mean = 34; $\sigma$=1.25; n=21
$\frac{1.25}{\sqrt 21}=0.27$

Mean=472.33; $\sigma$=26.2; n=8
$\frac{26.2}{\sqrt 8}=9.26$


#### Grams -> moles
Find molecular weight (total of all atomic mass)
$CO_2$ -> 2.34g
1 carbon (weighs 12u), 2 oxygen (weighs 16 $\times$ 2) = 44/mol
2.34g / 44/mol = 0.05 moles of $CO_2$

32.04g NaCl
Na=23
Cl=35.5
58.5u NaCl

32.04g / 58.5/mol = 0.55 moles of NaCl


Molarity:
Moles of solute / litres of solution
2 moles / 1L = Molarity of 2

58.44g of NaCl -> 1 mole
1 mole / 0.5L = Molarity of 2

5.7mg of NaCl in 0.3L of water. NaCl molecular mass = $58.4u$
$\frac{5.7}{58.4}$ = $9.76 \times 10^{-5}$
$\frac{9.76 \times 10^{-5}}{0.3}$ = $3.25 \times 10^{-4}$ -> $\times 1000$ = 0.325 mM (millimoles)
