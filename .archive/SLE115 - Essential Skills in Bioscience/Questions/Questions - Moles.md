### Question 26.1
Carbon dioxide has the formula CO2. The atomic
masses of these atoms are:
Carbon (C) 12.01 Da
Oxygen (O) 16.00 Da
*What is the molecular mass of carbon dioxide?*
44.01u

### Question 26.2
The relative molecular mass of ascorbic acid is 176.12. 
*How many moles are there in 528.36 g of ascorbic acid?*
(going off the triangle), $n=\frac{m}{M}$
moles = $\frac{528.36g}{176.12u} = 3 \text{ mol}$

### Question 26.3
Uric acid is $C_5H_4N_4O_3$
The component atomic masses are as follows:
Carbon (C) 12.01 Da
Hydrogen (H) 1.01 Da
Nitrogen (N) 14.01 Da
Oxygen (O) 16.00 Da
*What is the molecular mass of uric acid?*
`12.01 * 5 + 1.01 * 4 + 14.01 * 4 + 16 * 3` = 168.13$u$
### Question 26.4
The relative molecular mass of a substance is 300. 
*How many molecules does 1.5 kg of the substance contain?*
mol = $\frac{1500}{300}=5 \text{ mol}$
$5 \text{ mol} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} = 30.11 = 3.011 \times 10^{24}$

### Question 26.5
The molecular mass of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is 507.18 Da. It is estimated that the human body contains 250 g of ATP. 
*To two significant figures, how many moles is that?*
$n=\frac{m}{M}$; $n=\frac{250g}{507.18M}=4.9 \times 10^{-1}=0.49 \text{ mol}$

### Question 26.6
The molecular mass of glucose is 180.18 Da. 
*What mass of glucose is there in 200 ml of a 0.5 M solution?*
$180.18 \times 0.5 = 90.09g$; $\frac{90.09}{5}=18.02 \text{ mol}$
### Question 26.7
The molecular mass of urea is 60.06 Da. 
*What mass of urea is there in 100 ml of an 8 M solution?*
$m=n \times M$
$8 \times 60.06=480.48$
$\frac{480.48}{10}=48.048g$

### Question 26.8
*How much 0.25 M solution can be made from 500 ml of stock 1 M NaCl solution?*
$\frac{0.25M}{1M}=\frac{500 \text{ mL}}{x \text{ mL}}$
$\rightarrow \frac{500mL}{0.25Mx} \rightarrow x=2000mL$
$2000$

??????????????????

### Question 26.9
*How much water needs to be added to 100 ml of stock 8 M urea solution to dilute 
it to 5 M?*
$C_1V_1=C_2V_2$
$8M \times 100 = 5M \times x \text{ mL}$
-> $\frac{800}{5M}=160 mL$ of total solution
-> $160-100=$ 60$mL$ of water

#### Question from page 128 example
To calculate the amount of 10 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution needed to
make 50 ml of 2 M solution:
$C_1V_1=C_2V_2$
$10M \times x = 2M \times 50mL \rightarrow 10M \times x = 100 \rightarrow x=10mL$
$x=\frac{ 2M \times 50mL}{10M}=10mL$

### Question 26.10
The molecular mass of glucose is 180.18 Da.
*What is the molarity of a 5% w/v solution?*
5g/100mL
$x \times \frac{100}{1000}= 5g$
-> $x=50g$
-> $50g=n\times180.18$
-> n = 0.2775002775
### Question 26.11
The molecular mass of urea is 60.06 Da.
*What is the molarity of a 40% w/v solution, to three significant figures?*

### Question 26.12
Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) has one replaceable OH- ion per molecule. Its relative molecular mass is 40. *If 20 g of sodium hydroxide is made up to 1L with water, what is the normality of the resulting solution?*

Q1: How many moles of copper in 6,000,000 (6 million) atoms of copper?
1 mol/6,000,000 = $\frac{6.0 \times 10^{6}}{6.022 \times 10^{23}}=9.96^{-18}$
How many moles of element: $\frac{\text{amount of atoms}}{\text{avogadro's constant}}$

Q2: How many atoms in 5 moles of silver ($Ag$)?
$6.022 \times 10^{23} \times 5 mol = 3.01 \times 10^{24}$  

Q3: How many atoms of gold in 1 gram?
$n=\frac{1g}{196.9665u}=0.0051 \text{mol}$
$0.0051 \text{mol} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} = 3057372712100000000000=3.06 \times 10^{21}$  (21 figures before the front $3$)

Q4: How many moles of sulfur in 53.7 grams of sulfur?
$n=\frac{53.7g}{32.06}=1.68 \text{ mol}$

Q5: How many grams in a sample of $2.71 \times 10^{24}$ atoms of iron?
Convert to $\text{mol}$ first: $\frac{2.71 \times 10^{24}}{6.022 \times 10^{23}}=0.45 \times 10^{1} = 4.50 \text{ mol}$
$m=4.50 \text{ mol} \times 55.847u$
-> $251.3115 \text{ grams}$

Q6: How many moles of lithium ($Li$) in 1 mole of lithium hydride ($LiH$)?
1 mole of $Li$. Lithium hydride would be $1Li$ mole and $1H$ mole. Combined, they are one molecule, and as mole is defined by the number of elements/molecules, it would be 1 mole of $LiH$, not two

Q7: How many moles of oxygen are in 1 mole of calcium carbonate ($CaCO_{3}$)?
3 moles (as they are all disconnected from one another)

Q8: How many atoms of hydrogen in 1 mole of water ($H_{2}O$)?
$2 \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} = 1.204 \times 10^{24}$

Q9: How many atoms of oxygen in 2 moles of $O_{2}$?
$2 \text{ atoms} \times 2 \text { moles} \times (6.022 \times 10^{23})= 24.088 = 2.41 \times 10^{24}$

Q10: How many moles of oxygen in $2.71 \times 10^{25}$ molecules of $CO_{2}$?
$CO_{2} \text{ mol} = \frac{2.71 \times 10^{25}}{6.022 \times 10^{23}}=45.0 \text{ mol}$
$45.0 \times 2 = 90 \text{ mol in } O_{2}$
Not this: $o=\frac{45}{3}; 2o = 30 \text{ mols of oxygen}$
