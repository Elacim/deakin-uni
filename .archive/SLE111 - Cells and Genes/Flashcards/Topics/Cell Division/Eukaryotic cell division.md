Why may a chromatid be considered as a chromosome? :: The chromatid would be a copy
After DNA duplication in a 2n organism with 46 chromosomes, is it still 2n? How many chromosomes and chromatids? :: It is still 2n. It would still be a 2n organism with 46 chromosomes, but now with 92 chromatids
What chromosome number of a cell can undergo meiosis? :: Anything above 1n as a cell can not reduce further (to an integer)

- Sister chromatids are two copies of **one** chromosome

Count the chromosomes from the centromere (chromatid count does not influence chromosome count, centromere count does)
# Meiosis
Page 1141 of the textbook
![[Meiosis I - Diagrams (Page 1141).png]]

What is the goal of meiosis? :: To produce genetically distinct gametes for maximal variation and survival opportunity

In comparing mitosis metaphase and meiosis metaphase I, why does the same amount of genetic material (92 chromatids) result in different outcomes? :: In metaphase, homologous chromosomes line up like ----, whereas in metaphase, homologous chromosomes pair up and line up like ==== along the metaphase plate. This means that in metaphase, the chromatids are pulled apart while in metaphase I, the paired chromosomes are pulled away from each other


Animals:
1. 2 haploid cells (sperm and an egg) fuse to form a diploid cell (zygote)
2. This zygote splits through mitosis and proliferates into a full organism
3. Germ cells split through meiosis to form either haploid eggs or sperm

Plants:
1. 

What 3 events are exclusive to meiosis? :: In prophase I, synapsis and crossing over; In metaphase I, paired homologous chromosomes (tetrads) split; and in Anaphase I, the separation of homologous chromosomes

- modified type of cell division (only in sexually reproduction)
	- unlike mitosis, daughter cells have genetically distinct makeup
	- similar to mitosis, meiosis is preceded by chromosome replication
- two rounds of cell division
- one round of DNA replication
- Result is cells with half the number of chromosomal sets as the original
	- 4 daughter cells

### Meiosis I
After the DNA duplication done in $S$ phase, meiosis I starts with 1 tetraploid  (4n) cell

- preceded by interphase (where chromosomes are replicated - sister chromatids)
	- genetically identical, joined at centromere
In what Meiosis phase does chromosome condensation occur? :: Prophase I
What is a chiasma? :: The site of crossing over
Name for the site of crossing over :: Chiasma
What are homologues? :: The original and duplicate pairs of chromosomes that have undergone recombination
What does the synaptonemal complex do? :: It tightly connects homologous chromosomes along their lengths during prophase I
What two things may be considered homologous pairs of chromosomes? :: 1. Two chromosomes with one chromatid each (maternal and paternal); and 2. Two chromosomes comprised solely of a maternal and paternal chromatid and respectively replicated chromatid   
Are homologues identical? 

What are centrioles and what is their purpose (not including cellular division related tasks)? :: Organelles that organise microtubules, determining nucleus and other organelle positions
What is the role of centrioles in the context of cellular division? :: Organelles that permit mitotic spindle to form, and from this, pull chromosomes from the centre to opposite ends, allowing cells to split with half the genetic material
What are homologous chromosome? :: They are the inherited set of paternal and maternal chromosomes (i.e. Chromosomes 1-23 each have one paternal and one maternal, adding to a total of 43 chromosomes)
At what phase is DNA condensed into chromosomes? :: Prophase I
###### Prophase I
How much of Meiosis is spent in prophase I? :: Roughly 90% of time required for meiosis
What is the purpose of prophase I? :: To condense chromatin in chromosomes, pair them up intro tetrads, and undergo recombination
Are there any loose strands of DNA during prophase? :: At the start, all the DNA is loose within the nucleus, and as it begins to break down, it also starts to condense into chromosomes. By the end of prophase, the DNA is condensed into chromosomes and they are paired up.
What are homologous chromosome pairs held together by? :: Chiasma and sister chromatid cohesion proteins (cohesin)
What is 'cohesin' and it's purpose? :: A protein complex that holds homologous chromosome pairs together, known as sister chromatid cohesion
What is the purpose of pairing homologous chromosomes? :: It allows high levels of recombination to occur and is sensical for the segregation of chromosomes in Anaphase I

What is synapsis? :: The loose pairing up of homologous chromosomes and the alignment of them gene-by-gene
What is crossing over? :: It occurs during synapsis and is where non-sister chromatids exchange DNA segments, also known as recombination
What is a tetrad? :: Two chromosome pairs which are 4 chromatids

###### Metaphase I
What is the metaphase plate? :: An imaginary line going through the centre of a cell that the tetrads line up at
What are the primary differences between mitosis metaphase and meiosis metaphase I? :: Rather than a pair of chromosomes lining up at the metaphase plate and facing each pole of the cell, it is instead tetrads that line up. Microtubules then connect to the kinetochore of one chromosome from each tetrad rather than the centromere of a chromosome
What lines up at the metaphase I plate? :: Tetrads (two homologous chromosome pairs)
What part of a chromosome do microtubules connect to? :: Kinetochore of one chromosome
What direction do tetrads line up at the metaphase I plate? :: The face perpendicular to the centrioles (|- or -|)
Where are the tetrads positioned on the metaphase I plate? :: Along the cell equator between the centrioles (•|•)

What is a kinetochore? ::  A protein attached to the centromere which allows the chromosome be pulled without separating
What is a centromere? :: The central nub of a chromosome which when pulled, lets the two comprising chromatids to be separated
What is independent assortment? :: The random orientation of chromosomes, allowing increased genetic diversity

###### Anaphase I
- pairs of homologous chromosomes separate
- one chromosome to each pole (spindle guided)
- sister chromatids remain attached at the centromere
	- move as one unit to the pole

###### Telophase I and Cytokinesis
- each half has a haploid set of chromosomes
	- each chromo still has two sister chromatids
- cytokinesis
	- cleavage furrow
	- cell plate

### Meiosis II
After meiosis I, meiosis II starts with 2 genetically distinct diploid (2n) cells 

In the context of human cells, why are chromosomes not replicated again before Meiosis II? :: When haploid gametes fuse, they form a diploid cell (a 2n zygote), because of this, if the chromosomes were further replicated instead of being reduced, the fused gametes would form a debilitating tetraploid cell (4n)

- very similar to **mitosis**
	- key difference is the amount of genetic material
- In metaphase II, two sister chromatids of each chromosome are no longer genetically identical (due to crossing over in meiosis I)

## Plants
https://www.digitalatlasofancientlife.org/learn/embryophytes/life_cycle/

What does the '-phyte' suffix denote? :: It means plant or plant-like
Meaning of the name 'gametophyte' :: Gamete-producing plant
Meaning of the name 'sporophyte' :: Spore-producing plant

Gametophyte :: The haploid gamete, sexually reproducing stage of the plant life cycle
Examples of gametophytes :: Pollen grain, sperm, immature seed (ovule/eggs), 
Sporophyte :: The multicellular diploid stage of the plant life cycle that through **meiosis**, produces haploid spores
Examples of sporophytes :: Those dangly grass/moss bits, 
What exactly is a seed? :: A fertilised ovule that has matured
What does a seed contain? :: A sporophyte embryo and nutrition

Bryophyte sperm shape :: Human-sperm shaped but with two flagella
What is a sporangium? :: A spore-forming container/enclosure/receptacle
What is a sporange? :: An old fashioned word for sporangium (which is a spore-forming container)
What does 'sporangium' mean? :: Spore vessel (spora + angeion)

1. Female/Male gametophyte (1n) produces female/male gametes (1n) through mitosis 
2. Female + Male gametes fuse to form a (2n) zygote
3. The zygote splits through mitosis and forms (2n) sporophytes
4. The sporophytes produce (1n) spores through meiosis
5. The spores split through mitosis and grow into gametophytes

1. A gametophyte produces a sperm and another produces an egg
2. These fuse and form a zygote. This zygote develops into a seed.
3. This seed then develops into a sporophyte, like those dangly moss bits
4. The sporophyte's sporangium produces haploid spores which turn into gametophytes


Autogamy :: The self-pollination of a single flower (stamen-produced pollen pollinating it's ovules)
Geitonogamy :: The self-pollination of a single plant from one flower to another (pollen from one flower pollinates a different flower on the same plant)
Xenogamy :: The pollination of another plant (pollen from one plant's flower fertilises another plant's flower)

# Misc.
Independent assortment :: Random orientation and position of tetrads leads to a 50/50 chance of a maternal set going one way or vice versa, this is not forced and is independent of every other tetrad

1 cell with two chromosomes has two possibilities in metaphase 1
2 cells with four chromosomes has 4 possibilities (2 are duplicates)
```
Metaphase I (1 cell)
	bbrr             bbrr
	bbrr             rrbb
Metaphase II (2 cells)
	bb rr            bb rr
	bb rr            rr bb
Anaphase/Telophase/Cytokinesis II (4 cells)
	bb bb rr rr      br br rb rb
Since there are duplicates, the total combination count is 4
```
With humans, excluding crossover, the possible gamete count is $2^{23}=\text{roughly }8 \text{ million}$
With random fertilisation, the combination count is about 70 trillion 
Crossover, indepedent assortment, and random fertilisation = crazy town
