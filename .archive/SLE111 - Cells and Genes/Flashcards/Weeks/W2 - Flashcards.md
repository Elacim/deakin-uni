What is the range of cell sizes? :: Thought there are exceptions, cells are mostly in the 1-100 micrometer range due to SA:V ratio
<!--SR:!2023-07-30,1,230-->

### SA:V
What is the SA:V ratio? :: Surface Area : Volume ratio.
<!--SR:!2023-08-02,4,270-->
Do cells prefer a low or high SA:V ratio? :: High. A higher Surface Area means the cell's resource usage is not exorbitant and the cell's rate of molecular and energy transfer (resources going in/out, waste, thermal energy) is optimal.  ![[sa-vol-ratio_med.jpeg|300]] [Source - BioNinja](https://ib.bioninja.com.au/standard-level/topic-1-cell-biology/11-introduction-to-cells/sa--vol-ratio.html)
<!--SR:!2023-08-01,3,252-->
What would the effects on a cell with a low SA:V ratio be? :: It would have trouble transporting resources, organelles, disposing of waste, disposing of thermal energy, maintaining structure, and maintaining itself.
<!--SR:!2023-07-30,1,230-->

What is a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) best for? :: Detailed looks at the **external** structure of a material or living thing
<!--SR:!2023-08-02,4,270-->
What is a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) best for? :: Detailed looks into the **internal** structure of a material or living thing.

What is a halophile? :: A prok that thrives in extremely salty conditions. A direct translation from Greek is 'salt-loving'.
<!--SR:!2023-08-02,4,272-->
What is a thermophile? :: A prok that thrives in extreme heats, usually unsuitable for life.
<!--SR:!2023-08-01,3,250-->

<!--SR:!2023-08-02,4,272-->
Prok living environments :: Soil, rocks, oceans, water, ice, snow, plants, animals etc.
<!--SR:!2023-08-02,4,270-->

##### Pathogens
Pathogenic bacteria :: Causes disease when present in a host
<!--SR:!2023-08-02,4,270-->
Opportunistic pathogen :: Can only cause disease in a compromised host, otherwise there is no or little effect
<!--SR:!2023-08-01,3,252-->
Ways bacteria can cause disease :: Competing for resources (growth) and toxins
<!--SR:!2023-08-02,4,272-->
Exotoxin ::: Secreted by a bacteria (can cause food poisoning, cholera, diptheria)
<!--SR:!2023-07-30,1,230!2023-08-01,3,250-->
Endotoxin ::: Gram-negative bacteria exclusive. Found in the outer membrane. (can cause fever/aches, typhoid fever)
<!--SR:!2023-07-30,1,230!2023-07-30,1,230-->
Endospores :: Gram-positive exclusive bacteria (phylum *Bacilotta*) that can hibernate into sometimes dormant, highly stable, heat/cold/antiseptics/nutrient-starvation resistant spores that germinate when favourable conditions arrive. They can cause disease.
<!--SR:!2023-07-30,1,230-->

##### Symbiotic prokaryotes
[Source - Harvard](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/microbiome/)
What is microbial flora? :: Bacterial community (beneficial, neutral, or detrimental) existing outside or within an organism
<!--SR:!2023-08-01,3,250-->
Where are most bacteria found within the body? :: Everywhere, but especially the small and large intestines
<!--SR:!2023-08-02,4,272-->
Where are the least bacteria found within the body? :: Within the lungs and stomach
Microbial flora purpose :: Produces vitamins from nutrients, protects an organisms by competing with pathogens, breaks down food, recycles nutrients to chemical components
<!--SR:!2023-08-01,3,250-->
In what industries are microbes used? :: The dairy industry (flavour), vitamin production, sewage treatment, cleaning oil spills, general biotechnology
<!--SR:!2023-08-01,3,252-->
Nitrogen-fixing bacteria :: Live in root nodules, converting atmospheric nitrogen to usable ammonia for plants in exchange for plant-made sugars

##### DNA
Compared to Euks, how much DNA do Proks have? :: Approximately ~$\frac{1}{1000}$th the DNA
<!--SR:!2023-08-01,3,250-->
How is the DNA arranged in a Prok? :: It is a single DNA strand coiled within the nucleoid region, which is attached to the plasma membrane
<!--SR:!2023-07-30,1,230-->
Extrachromosomal DNA ::: Plasmid(s)
<!--SR:!2023-08-02,4,270!2023-08-02,4,270-->
Plasmids :: Non-essential ('added bonus') extrachromosomal DNA that often contain genes encoding antibiotic resistance. These are important in the field of Biotechnology.
<!--SR:!2023-08-02,4,272-->

##### Structures
The capsule :: A sticky outermost layer comprised of sugar polymers, assisting prokaryotes cling to each other and extraneous surfaces. It prevents the cell from drying out and also assists with pathogenicity.
Pili/Fimbriae :: Hair-like structure, involved in surface adhesion, facilitating of infection, and movement
<!--SR:!2023-07-30,1,230-->
Cell wall :: A protective, stiff outer layer made of *Peptidoglycan* (in Bacteria) and misc. polysaccharides (in Archaea)
<!--SR:!2023-07-30,1,230-->
Nucleoid region :: A region where DNA, RNA, and some proteins reside in a prokaryote. 
<!--SR:!2023-08-01,3,250-->

What structures do prokaryotes share with Eukaryotes? :: [[Ribosomes]], cytoplasm, [[Plasma membrane]], sometimes [[Flagella & Cilia]]. These can be loosely attached to the plasma membrane.
<!--SR:!2023-08-02,4,270-->
What structures do prokaryotes **not** share with Eukaryotes? :: The capsule (sticky outer layer), Pili/Fimbriae, [[Cell wall]], nucleoid region
<!--SR:!2023-07-30,1,232-->
How do intenral prokaryotic structures stay put? :: Some are loosely attached to the plasma membrane while others free flow within the [[Cytoplasm]].

##### Identification
How are proks identified? :: Through gene sequencing, inspecting membrane composition, size, shape, whether or not that are [[Aerobic and Anaerobic|aerobic or anaerobic]], it's nutrient requirements, and antibody studies

###### Gram staining
Gram-positive :: Stains blueish-purpleish. Large amounts of peptidoglycan are present, meaning the cell's top layer is comprised of peptidoglycan
<!--SR:!2023-08-02,4,270-->
Gram-negative :: Stains pinkish-redish. Small amounts of peptidoglycan are present, meaning the cell's top layer is an outer membrane with the middle layer being peptidoglycan 
<!--SR:!2023-08-02,4,272-->


### [[Eukaryotes]]
What are the three (3) main eukaryote types? :: Plant, animal, and fungi
