- Compounds can easily cross the membrane (dissolve into)
- Non-charged, water soluble compounds can diffuse through aqueous channels in proteins
- Larger hydrophillic compounds transported across membrane via energy dependant and non-energy dependant mechanisms
	- transport proteins
	- Non-dependant:
		- Molecules moving to a lower concentration area
		- Passive diffusion
		- Water-based is called osmosis
	- Dependant:
		- Move from high concentration to low concentration using ATP
		- Maintains concentration gradient

Dynamic equilibrium - the constant flow of molecules is even (e.g. 2 in, 2 out, not 0 in, 2 out)


# Transportation
#### Passive diffusion (transport)
Oxygen and CO2 enter/leave RBC by passive diffusion
- Osmosis is the transportation of water across a membrane
	- Proteins/sugars/amino acids cannot easily diffuse across membrane
		- water is required to move
- Solute can't pass? Movement of water dictates equilibrium
	- Water'll move from hypotonic (low conc.) solutions to hypertonic (high conc.) solutions 

- Tonicity - level of solute concentration in a solution ***relative to the cell***
	- Hypo = low -> "hype-oh no"
		- Water is always hypotonic
		- Too much water causes animals cells to burst (lysis)
		- Too much in plant cells will not lyse the cell due to the cell wall's turgidity
			- Turgor pressure - force exerted by stored water on cell wall. A cell is considered 'turgid' when full with high turgor pressure - normal plant cell state
	- hyper = high -> "high energy"
		- Animal cells -> shrivelling (crenating)
		- Plant cells
			- Plasmolysis
				- Plasma membrane peels wall from cell wall
				- Central [[Vacuoles|vacuole]] shrinks due to a lack of water
				- Turgidity is reduced
			- Cytorrhyis
				- Cell wall collapses due to water loss
				- Plants wilt
	- Isotonic = equal solute concentration
		- Gator/powerade
		- Water'll move in/out of cell in small quantities
		- Best state for animal cells
		- Plant cells become flaccid/floppy/soft

ATP - Adenosine Triphosphate: $C_{10}H_{16}N_{5}O_{13}P_{3}$

#### Facilitated transport
Does ***not*** need energy
Transport proteins provide channels for particular water soluble solutes
	selective
	some open only for specific circumstances

Transport across the membrane is dictated by the concentration gradient and electrical gradient
	- together is the electrochemical gradient
	- electrostatic repulsion/attraction of ions
		- sometimes competes w/ concentration gradient

#### Active transport
- goes against concentration gradient
- transport proteins use energy to let molecules across against the concentration gradient
	- ball on a hill, it's hard to push it up without energy
- Sodium-potassium pump
	- 3Na for 2$K^+$ -> hydrolysis of 1 ATP
	- (Na out, potassium in)

A gradient is maintained to use the potential energy of the gradient later on

#### Exo and endocytosis
Bulk transportation
Exo - moving stuff out the cell
Endo - moving stuff into the cell
Pinocytosis - liquid
Phagocytosis - solid
