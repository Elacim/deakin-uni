# Cell division
### 1. Replication
- the entire cellular genome is replicated
	- Interphase
	- Condensed into chromosomes
		- Replicated joined at centromere, named as sister chromatids
		- These are then split up later
- In a non-divided cell, DNA is relaxed - chromatin
### 2. Division
- genome is divided to two daughter cells, known as mitosis
- 
### 3. Cytokinesis
- division of cell body and dividing up of non-DNA components like organelles, membranes, and cytoplasm


# Cell cycle
G1 - first 'gap' - Interphase starts. cell grows, proteins and organelles are synthesised
S - DNA synthesis - DNA is copied and chromosomes duplicated
G2 - second 'gap' - further growth & prep for division
M - Interphase ends. Mitotic phase (cell division)
Cell cycle length - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9876/

# Classes
### [[Prokaryotes]]
- [[Binary Fission]] - cloning
- Endospore formation (bacteria but not all )
### [[Eukaryotes]]
- Mitosis - cloning
- Meiosis - sperm/egg are haploid (1n) and combined 2n. This means they have half then when fused, full chromosomal

# Mitosis
Just before mitosis, G2 happens - important to see what happens just before division but not actually part of mitosis
1. Growth
2. Repair - repair damaged tissues
3. Reproduction
# Phases (I-PMATc)
Slides 5b-6b
### G$_{2}$ phase
- chromosomes duplicate and begin to condense
- two DNA copies
- centrosomes already replicated (centriole pairs)
- primed for mitosis
- DNA is heavily condensed

### Prophase
- nucleolus breaks down - chromosomes appearing
- mitotic spindle begins formation
- not true - sister chromatids condense and form pairs - chromosomes
- As DNA was duplicated in $S$ phase, there are pairs of maternal chromosomes and paternal chromosomes

### Prometaphase
- 'late' prophase
- nuclear envelope breaks down - allowing internal space for cell division (splitting)
- chromatids finish condensing
- chromosomes pair up
- mitotic spindles continue to grow
- Kinetochores

### Metaphase
- Chromosome arms extend outwards
	align in middle at metaphase plate (roughly centre)
	Kinetochores attached to mitotic spindle microtubules

### Anaphase
- Sister chromatids pulled apart
	- Pulled towards opposite poin ales
- Microtubules push poles apart

### Telophase & Cytokinesis
- (technically two steps, they are concurrent though)
- two daughter cells form, cellular material is shared, and nuclear envelope is reformed
- mitotic spindle breaks down
- nuclear membrane reforms
- nucleolus reforms
- chromosomes decondense
- cytoplasm shared between cells
- 'cleavage furrow'
Animal cells only have to replicate the cell membrane - makes a cleavage furrow. Plant cells make a cell plate (Cellulose is hucked between the middle of the daughter plant cells till it forms a new [[Cell wall]])

##### Mitotic spindle
- apparatus of microtubules controlling chromosome movement during mitosis
- anaphase, sister chromatids separate and move along kinetochore microtubules towards opposite ends of the cell
- made of tubulin units


# Regulation
[Video: Cell Cycle Control | Cells | MCAT | Khan Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=542CMooowNY)

- $G_{1}, M, \text{and } G_{2}$ act as checkpoints
- Regulated by cyclins
- If a cell is at the $G_{1}$ checkpoint and doesn't receive a 'go-ahead' signal, it will be put into a dormant/hibernation state ($G_{0}$) either indefinitely or till it is ready
### Cyclins
- proteins
- Combine with $CdK$ - Cyclin-dependent kinases
	- If introduced to a non-dividing cell, it would begin to divide
- They form an MPF complex (maturation promoting factor), stimulating cells to divide
- MPF activity increases with cyclin levels
- MPF stimulates cell growth and division

# Cancer cells
- divide without barrier
	- growth factor dependence is lost
	- doesn't respond to normal growth-stopping signals
- cells proliferate to form a tumour - malignant cells can migrate to form new tumours
- Doesn't care about density-dependent inhibitions

Anchorage dependence :: The anchoring of a cell to a surface. Cancer does not follow this dependence.
Density-dependent inhibition :: A single layer of cells stops dividing due to this inhibition. If scraped away, they will divide until the gap is filled then stop. Cancer does not follow this inhibition.

# Part B

Metabolism - totality of organism's chemical reactions (anabolism and catabolism)
	Anabolism
		- synthesises larger, more complex molecules from smaller ones, consuming energy
		- 'anabolic steroids' - building up
	Catabolism
		- breakdown of large complex molecules to small simple molecules, releasing energy
		- 'catastrophic' - breaking things down

#### Chemical reactions
- Energy metabolism
- Biosynthesis (molecule synthesis - anabolism)
- Signal transduction
- Active transport (ATP being used)
- Motility
- Cell division

#### Energy coupling - enzyme catalysing
- Exergonic reactions (releasing energy)
	- 'Exit', energy exits
	- Occurs spontaneously
	- Energy utilised by Endergonic
- Endergonic (requires energy)
	- 'Enter', energy must enter
	- Non-spontaneous
	- Uses energy from exergonic reactions

#### ATP
- when hydrolysed, the products are a phosphate, ADP, and most importantly, energy
	- exergonic
- shuttle/transfer molecule for transferring energy
- Glutamic acid to glutamine w/o ATP is endergonic
- ATP hydrolysis is linked to glutamine production, making it exergonic
	- Positive $\Delta G$ = endergonic, negative $\Delta G$ = exergonic 
	- This means that ATP can make endergonic reactions exergonic

#### Enzymes
- Acts on compounds which is then called the substrate
- Catalytic protein that control a cell's chemical reactions
	- catalyse biochemical reactions
- Catalyst is a chemical agent that speeds up a reaction w/o being consumed by said reaction
	- lowers activation energy ($E_A$) needed for a reaction to occur
	- often supplied in the form of heat from system surroundings
- Only needed in small amounts due to reusability
- Ultra-specific
- Can denature (temperature, pH and other chemicals) and though unlikely through natural means, renature (can be done using human devised techniques like spinning in a tube with urea)
	- hot - denature -> can't be brought back
	- cold - hibernating -> can be brought back
- Names usually end with '-ase'
	- Protease (breaks down proteins)
	- ATPase (breaks down ATP)
	- Lipase (breaks down fats/lipids)
	- Polymerase (builds polymers)
	- Ligase (forms bonds)
- Active site with a lock and key mechanism
- Induced fit (enzyme hugs substrate so it can't leave)
- Without an enzyme present, a reaction will still occur but take more energy
	- with present, reactions require less energy
	- products are the same regardless of enzyme presence
![[Enzyme - activation energy with and without.png|200]]
Induced fit is maintained by 'weak interactions' like hydrogen/ionic bonds

###### Enzyme work cycle
- Slide 9

###### Speed factors
- concentration of substrate
- temperature
- pH of solution
- competing or inhibiting interpersonal substances

###### Effects
**pH**
- Optimal depending on environment (stomach acid)
- too low or too high = changes shape -> reduces ability to catalyse, can denature

**Temperature**
- hot - denature -> can't be brought back
- cold - hibernating -> can be brought back

Cells are bags of chemical reactions
	- known as [[Metabolism]]
	- reactions organised into metabolic pathways
		- building new molecules
		- breaking down old molecules
		- managing energy
	- Can regulate reactions by controlling currently active enzymes by using
		- activators
		- inhibitors
		- allosteric regulation

###### Temporary or permanent inhibition
- Competitive inhibition (slide 12b)
	- inhibitor binds to active site
	- resembles substrate 
- Non-competitive (13a)
	- inhibitor binds on enzyme but not on the active site
	- alters enzyme shape
		- altered enzyme = altered active site too
- Irreversible inhibition (13b)
	- Covalent bonds between inhibitor and enzyme
		- Permanently destroys enzyme functionality
	- such as pesticides or nerve gas agents

###### Cofactors
- non-protein 'helpers' for enzymes
- binds to active site temporarily or permanently
- often chemically charged during reaction`
- enzymes sometimes used metal ions as cofactors
	- Copper, Zinc, Iron
	- Accepts or donates electrons
	- Alters active site's charge
**Coenzymes**
- cofactors that are organic molecules
- most vitamins
	- some are raw materials *for* coenzymes, other *are* coenzymes
- Biotin (B7) - fat, glycogen, and amino acid synthesis
- Niacin (B3) - Energy production
- Folic acid (B9) - nucleic acid and amino acid metabolism

### Metabolic pathways
- series of one-way reactions controlled by enzymes
- allows enzymes to stick as their thing
- products in each step - metabolic intermediates
- each is substrate of the next enzymes in the pathway
###### Negative feedback 
- end product of pathway acts as an inhibitor of an enzyme at an earlier pathway step (feedback inhibition)
- stops cell wastage
- more efficient
- have a thing? turn it off. Don't have it? turn it on
###### Positive feedback
- Not usually metabolic, usually hormonal
- Oxytocin - stimulates uterine contractions, forcing the baby into the cervix, releasing more oxytocin, ad. infinitum
- Production of a product stimulates production of that product
