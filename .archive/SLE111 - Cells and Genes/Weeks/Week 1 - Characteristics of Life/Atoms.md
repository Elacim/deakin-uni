Atoms
	- Matter: Mass & takes up space
	- Solid/Liquid/Gas
	- Element - substance that can't be broken down further with *chemical reactions*

1st orbital - 2 electrons
2nd orbital - 8 electrons
3rd orbital - 8 electrons

The count of valence shell electrons determines the group the element is in on the periodic table. Valence means how many electrons it would take to fill the outermost shell of an atom's orbital
```
Hydrogen - valence of 1
Oxygen - valence of 2
Nitrogen - valence of 3
Carbon - valence of 4
This means that hydrogen can form 1 bond, oxygen 2 bonds, etc.
```
25 elements are essential to life
	- very important: carbon, oxygen nitrogen, hydrogen etc.
	- lesser so: magnesium, chlorine etc.
	- trace: zinc

Compounds can lead o very different results (H = explosive, O = flammable, H${_2}$O = water, putting out fires)

2+ atoms -> molecule, lots of simple molecules -> macromolecule

### Bond types
**Ionic bond (total electron transfer)**
	- e.g. Na + Cl -> Na${^+}$Cl${^-}$ -> NaCl
		- Na is the cation, Cl is the anion
- **Covalent bonds (electron sharing)**
	- 2 atoms sharing 1+ outer shell electrons
	- Oxygen to hydrogen atoms
	- Valency indicates the # of possible covalent bonds
- **Hydrogen bonds (electrical attractions)**
	- Weak electrical attractions between opposite poles
		- Water has a + & - end (poles), the hydrogens will be attracted on either end to other water molecules
- Intramolecular -> between same molecule species
- Inter -> between different molecular species
