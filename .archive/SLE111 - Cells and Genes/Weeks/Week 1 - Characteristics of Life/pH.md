pH - acidity measuring
	- pH = -log\[H${^+}$]
	- 0-14 (acidic to alkaline)
	- Acids are ionic that release hydrogen ions (H${+}$) in water (0-7)
	- Bases are ionic that release hydroxyl ions (OH${^-}$) in water (7-14)
	- Molecules with a pH of 7 are neutral
	- Changes in H+ and OH- can drastically affect a cell


Why do more protons make stuff 'acidic'? What is acidity? Do protons cause electrons to be ripped away from other atoms?
Do hydroxyl ions cause the same but with a different molecule?

Do acids like lemon juice react with other molecules which produces hydrogen ions?

All \[simply defined] acids contain hydrogen. On reacting with metals, all acids produce hydrogen gas. All acids produce hydrogen ions in water. Compounds that contain hydrogen but do not generate hydrogen ions in aqueous medium are not acidic.

| Type  | Donates   | Accepts   | Ion type |
| ----- | --------- | --------- | -------- |
| Acids | Protons   | Electrons | $H{^+}$  |
| Bases | Electrons | Protons   | $OH{^-}$ |

[[https://www.cliffsnotes.com/study-guides/biology/biology/the-chemical-basis-of-life/acids-and-bases|Base example]] - "when $NaOH$ \[(sodium hydroxide - base)] is placed into water \[(solvent)], it attracts $H{^+}$ and basic/alkaline solution results as $-OH$ ions accumulate" 
	-> $Na{^{+}OH{^{-}}}$ + $H{_2}O$ -> $Na{^+}_{(aq)}$ + $OH{^-}_{(aq)}$ 
		-> '$_{(aq)}$' means the given molecule/element is dissolved in water - $H_{2}O$ is assumed.
> Bases attract hydrogen ions in water and acids do not.
