Peer feedback (mark indexing)

After completion of the experimental plan and the group presentation, you will need to provide feedback to the other members of your group. This will be conducted using a tool called 'Feedback Fruits'. Please see the relevant section of this book for further details. This feedback helps to build on some of the following skills that will be transferable to a workplace environment:

    working collaboratively with peers
    managing the challenges that may come from working with others
    providing professional and constructive criticism to your peers
    processing and improving your own skills based on feedback

This feedback is a mandatory component of this authentic assessment task. The feedback for the experimental plan will be formative (will not contribute to your mark, but will provide useful feedback to your peers). The feedback for the presentation will be summative (will contribute to your mark, and will also provide useful feedback to your peers).

The score that you receive from your group on Feedback Fruits will be used as an index for your final grade for the authentic assessment task. 

For example: If your group scores 20/24, and you recieve 100% on Feedback Fruits, you would achieve a mark of 20/24. If another member of your group only scored 60% on Feedback Fruits, then they would only achieve 12/24 (60% of 20/24).

As such, it is critical that you make a fair contribution to your group throughout the trimester, to maximise the marks that you will be eligible for.
