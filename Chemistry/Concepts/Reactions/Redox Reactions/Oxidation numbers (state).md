What is an oxidation number? :: The charge of each element in a compound if it was monoatomic

How does oxidation affect the oxidisation number? :: It increases in oxidation number.
How does reduction affect the oxidisation number? :: It decreases in oxidation number.

## Rules
Is the oxidation number equivalent to an atom's charge? :: No but it is equal to an ion's (polyatomic or not) charge 
Are only whole numbers allowed in oxidation numbers? :: No. Fractional values of oxidation numbers are allowed along with whole numbers.

**Zeroes**
What is the oxidation number of any uncombined (free) element? :: It is 0.
Pure element oxidation numbers are zero: $O_{2}, P_{4}, F_{2}, Zn...$ all have an oxidation number of zero
What is the sum of all oxidation numbers of the atoms in a neutral molecule? :: It must equal zero.

**Equal to ion charge**
What is the oxidation number for any simple, monoatomic ion equal to? :: It is equal to the charge of the ion.
What must the sum of all the oxidation numbers in a polyatomic ion equal to? :: Be equal to the charge on the ion.

**Equal to anion**
When there is a binary ionic compound with a metal + non-metal, the non-metal has a charge equal to their anion.
Such as $\ce{Mg3P2}$ containing $\ce{P^{3-}}$, meaning $\ce{Mg = +2}$

**The constants**
What is Fluorine's oxidation number? :: $-1$
What is the oxidation number of all group 1 metals? :: $+1$
What is the oxidation number of all group 2 metals? :: $+2$


**Near-constants**
What is the most frequent oxidisation number of hydrogen? :: $1+$
When is hydrogen's oxidation number $1-$? :: When paired with metals (forming metal hydrides)

What is the most frequent oxidisation number of oxygen? :: $2-$
When is oxygen's oxidation number equal to $1-$? :: When in peroxides (e.g. $\ce{H2O2}$, $Li_{2}O_{2}$)
When is oxygen's oxidation number equal to $2+$? :: When paired with $F$ (forming $F_{2}O$)


## Determining oxidisation number
$\text{unknown} _{subscript} \times \text{ unknown (x)} + \sum\limits_{\text{known charges}} = \text{ion charge (0 if no charge)})$
	e.g. $MnO_{4}^{-}$ $\rightarrow O_{4} = -8$ $(-2 \times 4O)$ and $Mn$ is unknown as it's a metal
		$x + (-8) = -1 \rightarrow x, Mn = 7+$

$SF_{6}$; Since $F$ also has an oxidisation number of $-1$, $6 \times -1 = 6-$, $S$ must have an oxidisation number of $6+$


The charge of an ion is the oxidation number and vice versa

$CrO_{3}$; $O^{2-} \times 3 = 6-$. To make up the difference, $Cr$ must have $6+$

$KMnO_{4}$
$K = +1$ 
$Mn$
$O_{4}$ = $4 \times -2 = -8$
$x + (-8 + 1) = 0 \rightarrow x, Mn = 7+$

$PO_{4}^{3-}$
$O_{4}$ = $-8$ oxidisation charge
$x + -8 = 3- \rightarrow x = 5+$ 
$P = P^{+5}$

$Na_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7}$
$O_{7} = 2 \times 2- = 14-$
$Na_{2} = 2 \times +1 = 2+$
$Cr_{2} = (14- + 2+) = 12$
