What groups in the periodic table are the strongest reducing agents? :: Groups 1 and 2
What characteristics do strong reducing show? :: Highly reactive with water and low ionisation energy
What happens to reducing power as ionisation energy increases? :: It decreases

Which element types are the strongest oxidising agents? :: Reactive non-metals
How does electron affinity tie into oxidisation strength? :: Most favourable electron effinity
SLIDE 5a

Electron affinity - the energy released when electrons are gained

What is an oxidation number? :: A value indicating if an atom is neutral, electron rich, or electron poor
Why is the term 'oxidisation number/state' used instead of 'charge'? :: Only ions can have charge but any compound can be oxidised/reduced(NOT TRUE - RESEARCH MORE)
What is the purpose of oxidisation numbers? :: To keep track of electrons in redox reactions

### AN OIL RIG CAT
What does `AN OIL RIG CAT` stand for? :: Anode: Oxidation is Loss **|** Cation: Reduction is Gain
Does oxidation happen at the anode or cathode? :: The anode (**AN OIL** RIG CAT)
Does reduction happen at the anode or cathode? :: The cathode (AN OIL **RIG CAT**)

### Oxidisation and reduction agents
What is an oxidising agent to electrons? :: It has the ability to remove electrons from another atom (the one getting reduced)
What is a reducing agent to electrons? :: It has the ability to donate electrons from another atom (the one getting oxidised)
A bond is a pair of electrons

When referring to chemical species reacting with another, talk about the reactant side, not the product side

Reducing/oxidising on left hand

Pale blue - Cu2+ ion
Greenish - Cu+ ion

What is the reducing and oxidising agent in $Cu_{(s)} + 2Ag^{+}_{(aq)} \rightarrow Cu^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2Ag_{(s)}$? :: $C$

If something is being reduced, what type of agent is it? :: It is an oxidising agent
If something is being oxidised, what type of agent is it? :: It is a reduction agent

In organic reactions, what does oxidisation refer to? :: The loss of oxygen atoms
In organic reactions, what does reduction refer to? :: The gain of oxygen atoms
In inorganic reactions, what does oxidisation refer to? :: The loss of electrons
In inorganic reactions, what does reduction refer to? :: The gain of electrons

What does an oxidising agent undergo? :: Reduction
What does an reduction agent undergo? :: Oxidisation
What happens to an oxidising agent in terms of electrons? :: It becomes more negative as it gains electrons
What happens to a reducing agent in terms of electrons? :: It becomes more positive as it loses electrons

What is being reduced and oxidised in:
$2I^{-}_{aq} + Br_{2 aq} \rightarrow I_{2 aq} + 2Br_{aq}^{-}$?
?
- Iodine is being oxidised, losing (2 total) electrons
- Bromine is being reduced, gaining (2 total) electrons

What is being reduced and oxidised in:
$2Na^{+} + Cl^{-}_{2g} \rightarrow 2NaCl_{s}$
What are the reducing and oxidising agents?
?
$Na$ is being oxidised and is the reducing agent
