25mL $HNO_{3}$ titrated against 21.35mL $KOH$ solution w/ concentration of 0.155M
$HNO_{3} + KOH \rightarrow H_{2}O + KNO_{2}$
$n(KOH)=0.155 \times 0.02135 = 0.00330925M$
Since it's a 1:1 ratio,
$C=\frac{0.00330925M}{0.025L}=0.13237$

In a titration of a 20mL sample of lactic acid ($CH_{3}CHOHCOOH$) with sodium hydroxide ($NaOH$), it was found that 17.25mL of 0.155M $NaOH$ was required to reach the equivalence point. How much lactic acid was in the sample in grams?
?
$CH_{3}CHOHCOOH + NaOH \rightarrow CH_{3}CHOHCOONa + H_{2}O$
C: x and 0.155M
V: 20mL and 17.25mL
$C_{1} \times 20mL = 0.155M \times 17.25mL=0.13368$ moles
Lactic acid g/mol = 90.0786, $\times 0.13368 = 12.042$ grams

What is the acid, base, conjugate base, and conjugate acid in: $CH_{3}NH_{2} + H_{2}O \rightarrow CH_{3}NH_{3}^{+} + OH^{-}$
?
Acid: $CH_{3}NH_{2}$
Conjugate acid: $OH^{-}$
Base: $CH_{3}NH_{3}^{+}$
Conjugate base: $CH_{3}NH_{3}^{+}$

A 15mL sample of $HNO_{3}$ is titrated against a 0.180 mol/L ($_M$) $KOH$ solution. 19.82ml of $KOH$ is required to reach the endpoint. Calculate the $HNO_{3}$ concentration.
?
$HNO_{3} + KOH \rightarrow KNO_{3} + H_{2}O$
$C_{1} \times 0.015mL = 0.180_M \times 0.01982mL$
$C_{1}=0.238_M$
