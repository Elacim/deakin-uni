$E=mc^{2}$
$E=hv=\frac{hc}{\lambda}$
$c=\lambda v$

The four characteristics of light ::: Frequency ($v$), Wavelength (**$\lambda$**), Amplitude, and Phase
Frequency of light ::: Number of crests/maximums passing a point in space in Hz ($v$)
Wavelength of light ::: Distance between crests/maximums ($\lambda$)
Amplitude of light ::: Max displacement of a wave from the centre
Phase of light ::: The changing of the start/end point of a wave by shifting it left/right
The Frequency and Wavelength of light is inversely proportional to each other
What characteristic of light determines the intensity? ::: Amplitude
What is the speed of light ($c$)? :: $2.998*10{^8}$ $m/s^{â€“1}$
Does wavelength or frequency impact the speed of light? :: No. All electromagnetic radiation travels at the speed of light, $c$
Can light be considered a particle and a wave? :: True.

Photon energy formulas
??
$E=hv$
$E=\frac{hc}{\lambda}$
$E$=Photon energy; $h$=Planck constant; $f/v$=photon frequency
$c$=speed of light in a vacuum; and $\lambda$=photon wavelength

Each photon's energy = planck's constant \* photon's frequency
Or -> freq * speed of light \\ wavelength
Lambda = wavelength in meters
N nu (Greek nu) = frequency in Hz
Light moves at 2.998
##### Particle properties of light
Photoelectric effect -> when a light is shone on metal, it produces electrons and can complete a circuit
Below a certain freq, no electrons are emitted
Higher freq = electron energy increases linearly
