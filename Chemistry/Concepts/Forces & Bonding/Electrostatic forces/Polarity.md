Solubility of polar compounds in water compared to non-polar in water :: A lot better as water is polar
Boiling point of polar compounds compared to non-polar :: Higher
Vapour pressure of polar compounds compared to non-polar :: Higher

General geometry of non-polar compounds :: Symmetrical geometry
General geometry of polar compounds :: Asymmetrical geometry

#### Questions
Why is $\ce{NH3}$ polar? :: It seems it should be symmetrical with [[Trigonal planar geometry]] but it has $5$ [[Valence electrons|valence electrons]]. It bonds to the $\ce{3H}$ then has a lone pair above it, causing it to be polar and have a [[Trigonal pyramidal geometry]].
