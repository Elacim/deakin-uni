? :: The actual amount of positive nuclear charge experienced by electrons in an atom
	The amount of protons an electron 'sees'

Why 'effective charge'? :: Due to electron shielding, an electron does not feel the full positive charge, so effective takes this in to account

called the effective nuclear charge $Z_{eff}$

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_nuclear_charge

What is $\ce{Z_{eff}}$? :: The effective atomic number / effective nuclear charge
What does $\ce{Z_{eff}}$ tell us? :: An outer electron experiences less charge than full nuclear charge (as if the atom is of mass $\ce{Z}$)

What concept does effective nuclear charge help explain? :: Why electrons in outer shells are loosely bound 

##### $\ce{Fe}$ electron charge
$\ce{^{56}_{26}Fe}$
: $\ce{1s^{2} 2s^{2} 2p^{6} 3s^{2} 3p^{6} 3d^{6} 4s^{2}}$

An iron electron in the $1s^{2}$ orbital feels the force of $\frac{25}{26}$ protons. 
	Not the full 26 due to the other electron in the orbital.

In contrast, an iron electron in the $4s$ orbital feels an attractive force of $5.43$ due to [[Electron shielding (screening)]] 

##### Charges per orbital
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_nuclear_charge#Values
In this wikipedia page, we can see the effective nuclear charge on each successive orbital decrease. This is due to the shielding effect and the increasing distance between the electrons and the nucleus.
