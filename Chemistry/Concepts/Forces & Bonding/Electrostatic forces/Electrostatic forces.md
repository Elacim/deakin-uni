Electron to nuclei interaction :: Attraction (electron-nucleus attraction)
Electron to electron interaction :: They repel (electron repulsion)
Nuclei to nuclei interaction :: They repel (nuclear repulsion/force)

What do electrostatic forces 'aim' to provide to an atom by balancing positive and negative forces? :: Stability

What force occurs and is overpowering when an atom is too close to another? :: Nuclear repulsion
What happens when an atom is too far from another? :: Either electron-nucleus attraction dominates, making electrons attracted to both nuclei or, when far away enough, there will be no interaction.

#### Stability
At what point is a bond most stable? :: At the distance of the bond length

How do **electron-nucleus attractions** affect the molecule stability? :: Being energetically favourable, they decrease the energy and increase the stability
How do **electron repulsion interactions** affect molecule stability? :: They reduce it as they raise the energy
How do **nuclear repulsion interactions** affect molecule stability? :: They reduce it as they raise the energy
