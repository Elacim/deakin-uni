Where are they found? :: Furthest from the nucleus
What, in terms of energy levels, are they? :: The highest energy, so the least stable

What does the available number of them indicate? :: The chemical properties of an element, being similar if in the same groups (such as the halogens, active metals, etc.)

##### Determining non-transition metals
Groups 1/2: $1/2$ valence electrons
Groups 13+: $\ce{10 - group number}$ valence electrons

###### Derivation
A few things need to be taken into account:
- How many electrons are in the highest orbital
- Is it easier for the element to gain or lose electrons?

For $\ce{Be}$, $1s^{2}: \uparrow \downarrow || 2s^{2} \uparrow \downarrow$. 
The highest orbital is $2$ with 2 electrons, so it has a total of $2$ valence electrons
If bonding, it is more inclined to lose the highest orbital electrons than to gain more in it's $p$-shell.

For $\ce{Ga}$, $\ce{[Ar]}  4s^{2}: \uparrow \downarrow || 3d^{10} || 4p^{1}: (\uparrow -) (--) (--)$
The highest orbital - not energy - is $4$. Therefore, these ($3e^{-}$) are the valence electrons.  

For $\ce{Sn}$, $\ce{[Kr] 5s^{2}:\uparrow \downarrow || 4d10 || 5p^{2}: (\uparrow -)(\uparrow-)(--)}$
There are 4 valence electrons found within the highest orbitals ($5$). It can gain or lose these but the only found ones in nature have them lose ($\ce{Sn^{2+} and Sn^{4+}}$)

For $\ce{S}$, $\ce{[Ne]} 3s^{2}: \uparrow \downarrow || 3p^{4}: (\uparrow \downarrow) (\uparrow -) (\uparrow-)$
The highest orbital is $3$, and since there are 6 electrons in the orbital, there are 6 valence electrons for sulphur. 

For $\ce{Al}$, $\ce{[Ne] 3s^{2}:\uparrow \downarrow || 3p^{1} : (\uparrow-)(--)(--)}$
The highest orbital is $3$, there are 3 electrons in $3$, so there are $3$ valence electrons.
