Another name for resonance :: Mesomerism

#### Requirements
Why does resonance occur? :: 3 lined up p-orbitals forming a pi bond network causing the double bond to be in both places at once
	See: [[Triple-double bonds]] 

What is the main requirement of a resonance structure? :: That the molecule has double bond(s)

What are the most common conditions for resonance to occur? :: A double bond (N, C, O, likely oxygen) adjacent to a negatively (formal) charged oxygen

What stops a molecule from continuing resonance? :: Protonation (eliminates the negative charge)

#### Properties
Effects of resonance :: A more stable state and lower energy

Resonance molecules are not strong bases ( #question verify this) due to the negative charge constantly shifting and therefore struggling to 'catch' protons

$\ce{CO3^{2-}}$ is more stable cause the coreactant can't catch the electrons
$\ce{HCO3-}$ is less stable because it has less structures, and therefore the electrons can be easier caught

##### Delocalised charge
Delocalised charge description :: When a charge spends half the time at one point and half the time at another (i.e. in the middle)
What effect does a delocalised charge have on a molecule? :: It stabilises the molecule
Name of a molecule that has a delocalised charge :: Resonance-stabilised anion

#### Representation
What is used to represent resonance in drawn molecular formulas? :: A single bond line next to a dashed line 
What do dashes represent in resonance structures? :: They represent half a bond, i.e. [[#Delocalised charge]]
