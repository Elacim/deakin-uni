Electrons, when photons hit them, go up an energy state then back down near-immediately. When they move down, they release energy by emitting photons 

e.g. $2p$ is an energy (shell) of $2$ and subshell $p$
`n` - (principle) Describes the energy of the orbital (shell)
`l` - (azimuthal) Describe the type of orbital/"subshell" (eg s,p,d,f)
`ml` - (magnetic) Describes the orientation of the orbital
`ms` - (spin) Describes the spin of the electron


Quantum numbers - country, state, city, street
n - principle quantum number (country) - Bohr model: shell number (e.g. calcium on the 4th row)
	- Overall energy of electron
	- Positive integer (not a fraction) -> 1..Infinity (integers only)
	- Correlated to orbital size (higher n, higher orbital)
	- higher n -> electron has more energy, orbital is larger, and it is therefore less bound to the nucleus


L - azimuthal quantum number (state) - Bohr model: subshell (region of a shell - energy) w/ a certain shape
	- has a number of degenerate orbitals (orbitals with same energy levels) 
	- Always \< n (can be zero)
	- Relates to angular momentum of orbital
	- Identifies electron distribution shape
	- L=1 -> s / L=1 ->p / L=2 -> d orbital

m$_{l}$ - magnetic quantum number - Bohr model: which orbital ()
- 'Of these degenerate orbitals, which one?' -L,..,..0,..,..+L 	
 - Relates to possible orientations
	- Can be positive/negative int between zero and L
	- 2L + 1 possible values for m
		- for n=1, only l=0 is possible, so ml can only = 0
		- for n=2, two values of L (0 or 1)
			- for L=0, m=0       for L=1, m=-1, 0 or 1
		- for n=3, 3 L values (0, 1, or 2)
			- For L=2, ml={-2, -1, 0, 1, or 2}

m$_{s}$ - spin quantum number. Up/down, 
	- electrons in same orbital cannot have the same spin
	- behaves 2 ways in a magnetic field (spin up or down)
	- +1/2 or -1/2 for each electron

Aufbau 
Atoms with their shells fully filled are *diamagnetic* and are not effected by magnetic fields
Without - *paramagnetic*, meaning they are affected by magnetic fields
