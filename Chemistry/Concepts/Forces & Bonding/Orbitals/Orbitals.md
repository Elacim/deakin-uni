? :: Orbitals are areas (shape of space) within atoms where there is a high probability of finding electrons.

How many electrons can a subshell have? :: 2 total 

| Orbital | Subshells | $e^{-}$ | Shape |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | ---- |
| $s$ | $1$ | $2$ | Spherical |
| $p$ | $3$ | $6$ | A thin-waisted shelled peanut |
| $d$ | $5$ | $10$ | Eggs and a donut |

What does it mean when an orbital has a 'high probability of finding electrons' in it? :: Perhaps a 90% chance of finding an electron within the orbital/subshell and 10% not in.

How is the name 'orbitals' wrong? :: 'Orbit' is a misnomer taken from Bohr's model. They do not orbit - we can not know the path they are taking.

How do orbitals fill? :: 1 electron per orbital until filled, then pairs

The 2s electrons energy > 1s electrons. Therefore, on average, the 2s electrons are more distant from the nucleus and the orbital larger
