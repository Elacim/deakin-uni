#### Types of solids - [[W8 - Flashcards#Solids]]
MAMIN - Molecular, amorphous, metallic, ionic, and network
- Slowly cooling pure liquids until it solidifies into a crystalline solid

**Molecular solids** - covalent; soft crystals that melt at low temperatures; doesn't conduct; evaporates easy

**Amorphous** - non-crystalline solids

**Metallic solids** - electrons are delocalised (sea of electrons); 
- ductile, lustrous, malleable, conductive, high melting point
- Conducts as a solid and liquid 
- properties differ because of valence electron count
- Middle metals have the highest melting points
- $Fe$; $Mg$

**Ionic compounds** - hard crystalline solids that melt at high temperatures; resistant to evaporation
- properties come from internal structure (alternating cations and anions)
- Conduct as liquids
- $NaCl$

**Covalent compounds** - lots of molecules held by relatively weak intermolecular forces
- Individual molecules are held by intramolecular covalent forces

**Network solids**
- Covalent bonds
- High melting points; difficult to break bonds; hard; poor conductors
- Diamond and Quartz ($SiO_{2}$)
