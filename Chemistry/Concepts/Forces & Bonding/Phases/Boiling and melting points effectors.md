| Effectors | Effect | Example(s) |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| [[Polarity]] | Increase | Nearly all functional groups |
| Pressure | Increase | When atmos. pressure = vapour -> boiling |
| High electron count | Increase | Anions, $\ce{I2}$, big molecules |
| Big molecules | Increase | $\ce{C6H12O6}$ |

All alks are non-polar and therefore have low melting and boiling points.
These raise as the number of carbons increase.

Alcohols have a significantly greater boiling point than of alks with similar molar-masses


Assuming similar molar masses, the boiling points of some functional groups from highest to lowest goes:
1. Alcohols
2. Amines
3. Ethers
	2. & Alkyl halides
4. Thiols
5. Alks
