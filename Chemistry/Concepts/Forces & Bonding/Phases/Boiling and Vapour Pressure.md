#### Boiling point
[Atmospheric Pressure and Boiling - Wayne Breslyn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiwynTBdln8)

What is the boiling point? :: The temperature at which the average kinetic energy of molecular motion balances the attractive energy of intermolecular attractions

- boiling point is higher the stronger intramolecular forces are
	- More electrons = greater dispersion forces = higher boiling point
- bubbles are pockets of gaseous liquid - happens when there is enough spread between molecules
- When atmospheric pressure is equal to the vapour pressure of the liquid, the liquid will boil
- Boiling points INCREASE with pressure and therefore need more energy
	- pressure holds the molecules closer together, preventing bubbles from forming
- Lowest boiling point testing
	- High polarities mean higher boiling points
	- Bigger molecules mean higher boiling points (bigger = stronger INTERmolecular interactions)

#### Vapour pressure
Vapour pressure is like atmospheric pressure pushing against a liquid except in reverse.
It is the liquid's gaseous molecules pushing against the atmospheric pressure, reducing the pressure on the liquid
When the vapour pressure is increased, say by heating the liquid, the liquid now has more gas (vapour) pushing against the atmospheric pressure. This push allows bubbles to form

**Vapour pressure** :: Molecules of a liquid escaping from the liquid (such as in gaseous form) pushing against the atmospheric air molecules

What does a **low vapour pressure** mean? :: The solution has strong inter/intramolecular attractions and therefore does not push strongly (put pressure) against the atmosphere
What does a **high vapour pressure** mean? :: The solution has weak inter/intramolecular attractions and therefore pushes strongly against the atmosphere as molecules escape

**Effectors**
Effect of strong bonds between molecules/atoms :: A lower vapour pressure. [[Inter and intramolecular forces|Inter/intramolecular forces]] all affect vapour pressure. 

Effect of lowering pressure :: The molecules are less held together and therefore more readily form bubbles - boiling!
Effect of raising pressure :: The molecules are forced together, becoming tighter knit, therefore needing increasingly more energy to form bubbles and boil

**Boiling**
Boiling can happen when either the vapour pressure is increased or the atmospheric pressure is decreased

High vapour pressures = lower boiling point

Increase vapour pressure by heating a liquid (causing gas to assimilate into the atmosphere)
	Once equal to atmosphere pressure, the liquid will boil
