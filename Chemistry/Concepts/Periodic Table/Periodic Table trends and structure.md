Periods - rows - horizontal
Groups - columns - vertical

### Electron counts
Groups 1-3: $+1..+3$
Group 13: $+3$
Groups 15-17: $-3..-1$

### Size
- Increases down groups in the periodic table
- Decreases across periods
- Smaller distance between atoms leads to a higher bond strength ($H-F$ > $H-Br$)
	- As bond length goes down, bond strength goes up
- Large molecules tend to have greater intermolecular strength due to the high prevalence of and opportunities for van der Waals forces due to electron densities

### Electronegativity ($\chi$)
- tends to increase from bottom to top and left to right
- Hydrogen is highly electronegative though
- Noble gases are generally not electronegative (except $Kr$ and $Xe$)
- Metallic atoms have low 
- Halogens + reactive non-metal have higher

### Ionisation energy (eV)
- Increases left to right (within a period) due to valence shell stability
- Decreases top to bottom (with a group) due to electron shielding
- The bigger an atom, the less connected they are to their electrons (and therefore eV decreases)
- Noble gases are the most stable and therefore need more energy to lose their electrons
- The higher the energy, the harder it is for that element to become a cation

### Electron affinity
- Increases left to right (decrease in atomic radius)
- Decreases top to bottom (increase in atomic radius)
- the ability of an element to accept an electron (more negative = higher affinity)
- Group 17 has the highest electron affinity
- Group 16 and 14 have the second highest (roughly half the affinities of group 17's elements) 

### Melting/boiling point
- [[Phase Changes]]
- Transition metals have the highest
- Carbon is a major exception, reaching melting/boiling points higher than a fair chunk of metals
- Affected by the strength of intermolecular bonds

### Density ($g/cm^{3}$)
- Transition metals have the highest densities
	- Hafnium (72) through to Gold (79) and Palladium (91) to Plutonium (94) have the highest densities

### Acidity
Acidity increase going across periods and going down groups.
It therefore increases with atomic size.
