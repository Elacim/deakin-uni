What is solubility affected by? :: Polarity of molecules and the size of the molecule 

Effectors of solubility
?
- Molecule polarity and functional groups that contribute to polarity
- Molecule size #question is size a factor?
- The amount of carbons compared to other atoms (more = less soluble)

How is solubility affected by the addition of heat to an exothermic reaction? :: The solubility will DECREASE as this excess heat 

Why is solubility affected by a gain/loss of temperature? :: The equilibrium shifts to counteract the change, altering the reaction state (endo/exothermic), which in turn causes the ion dissolvability to alter

What functional group(s) have high solubility? :: Alcohols do as they have (an) $OH^{-}$ group(s) which has high polarity. 

##### Solubility product
Solubility product symbol :: $K_{sp}$ 
Solubility product formula 
?
Given $\ce{aA_{(s)} <=> cC + dD}$,
$K_{sp} = [C]^{c} [D]^{d}$

What does $K_{sp}$ tell us? :: Higher values mean a solute is more soluble
