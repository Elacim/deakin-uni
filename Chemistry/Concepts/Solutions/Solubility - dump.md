Chapter 10
Ionic compounds can dissolve in water when the attractions between water dipoles and ions overcome both the attractions of the ions for each other within the crystal and the attractive forces between water molecules in bulk water. Similar events explain why solids composed of polar molecules, such as those of sugar, dissolve in water (see figure 10.17). Attractions between the solvent and solute dipoles help to dislodge molecules from the crystal and bring them into solution. Again, we see that ‘like dissolves like’; a polar solute dissolves in a polar solvent.
The same reasoning explains why non-polar solids, such as wax, are soluble in non-polar solvents, such as benzene. Wax is a solid mixture of long-chain hydrocarbons held together by dispersion forces. The attractions between the molecules of the solvent (benzene) and the solute (wax) are also due to dispersion forces of comparable strength. When intermolecular attractive forces within solute and solvent are sufficiently different, the two do not form a solution. For example, ionic solids or very polar molecular solids (such as sugar) are insoluble in non-polar solvents such as benzene and hexane. The molecules of these hydrocarbon solvents are unable to attract ions or very polar molecules with enough force to overcome the much stronger attractions that the ions or polar molecules experience in the solid state.



Neutral organic molecular species are most soluble in:
Non-polar solvents like hydrocarbons because of the intermolecular forces between the ions and the solvent.


48.4 g of potassium bromide are dissolved in 83.8 mL of water. What is the concentration of the resulting solution? Remember to add the appropriate unit. Use the solutions chapter to help answer this question
5.78 %w/v
The correct answer is: 4.85 M
61.7 g of potassium bromide are dissolved in 75.9 mL of water
70.5 g of potassium bromide are dissolved in 82.5 mL of water. What is the concentration of the resulting solution?
$C_{1}V_{1}=C_{2}V_{2}$
Molarity = mol of solute / L of solute

$KBr=39.0983+79.904=119.0023$ mol
$\frac{\frac{70.5g}{119.0023 mol}}{82.5 \div 1000}=\frac{0.59}{0.0825}=7.18$ M


Assume household vinegar contains 5% acetic acid by weight and that the density of vinegar is the same as the density of water, 1.00g/mL
How many moles of acetic acid are present in 402 mL of household vinegar?
402mL \* 0.05 = 20.1g of acetic acid
