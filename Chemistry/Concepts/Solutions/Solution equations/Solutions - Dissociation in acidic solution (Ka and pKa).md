##### Given only $\ce{K_{a}}$
A student prepared a buffer solution made up of $\ce{NH3}$ and $\ce{NH4Cl}$. What is the pH of the buffer when $\ce{[NH3] = 0.25M}$ and $\ce{[NH4Cl] = 0.45M}$?
The $\ce{K_{a}}$ of ammonium is $5.56 \times 10^{-10}$

1. First, establish the [[Equilibrium]] formula
	1. $\ce{NH4+ + H2O_{(l)} <=> NH3 + H3O+}$
2. Establish the acids, bases, and the conjugates of each
	1. $\ce{NH4+}$ = acid, $\ce{NH3}$ = conjugate base
	2. $\ce{H2O}$ = base, $\ce{H3O+}$ = conjugate acid
3. We want to calculate the concentration of the $\ce{H3O+}$ ions, so establish the $\ce{K_{a}}$ formula
	1. $\ce{K_{a} = \frac{[NH3]^{1} [H3O+]^{1}}{[NH4+]^{1}} }$
	1. $\ce{5.56 \times 10^{-10} = \frac{[NH3]^{1} [H3O+]^{1}}{[NH4+]^{1}} }$
4. Rearrange the equation to find the $\ce{H3O+}$ ions
	1. $\ce{K_{a} = \frac{[NH3] [H3O+]}{[NH4+]}}$
	2. Take the reciprocal of $\ce{NH4+}$
		1. $\ce{K_{a} \times \frac{[NH4+]}{[NH3]}= \frac{[NH3] [H3O+]}{[NH4+]} \times \frac{[NH4+]}{[NH3]}}$
	3. $\ce{[H3O+] = K_{a} \times \frac{[NH4+]}{[NH3]}}$
5. Plug in the $\ce{K_{a}}$ and other known concentrations and calculate
	1. $\ce{[H3O+] = 5.56 \times 10^{-10} \times \frac{0.45M}{0.25M}}$
	2. $\ce{[H3O+] = 1.0 \times 10^{-9}M}$
6. Calculate the $\ce{pH}$ using $\ce{-log_{10}[H3O+]}$
	1. $\ce{ pH = -log[1.0 \times 10^{-9}M]}$
	2. $\ce{pH = 9.0}$

##### Given $\ce{pKa}$
A student prepared a buffer solution made up of $\ce{NH3}$ and $\ce{NH4Cl}$. What is the pH of the buffer when $\ce{[NH3] = 0.25M}$ and $\ce{[NH4Cl] = 0.45M}$?
The $\ce{pKa}$ of ammonium is $9.26$.

1. First, establish the [[Equilibrium]] formula
	1. $\ce{NH4+ + H2O_{(l)} <=> NH3 + H3O+}$
2. Establish the acids, bases, and the conjugates of each
	1. $\ce{NH4+}$ = acid, $\ce{NH3}$ = conjugate base
	2. $\ce{H2O}$ = base, $\ce{H3O+}$ = conjugate acid
3. Plug in the values to Henderson's equation for pH
	1. $\ce{pH = pK_{a} + log(\frac{[conj. base]}{[acid]})}$
	2. $\ce{= 9.26 + log(\frac{0.25M}{0.45M})}$
	3. $\ce{pH = 9.004 = 9.00}$
