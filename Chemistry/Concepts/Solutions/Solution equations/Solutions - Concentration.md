Why would $0.2_{M}$ of $NaCl$ be the same concentration as $0.2_{M}Br_{7}O_{4}$? :: $C=\frac{n}{V}$. $NaCl: 0.2_{M}=\frac{n}{0.2L}$ vs $Br_{7}O_{4}: 0.2_{M}=\frac{n}{0.2L}$. From this, we can tell the $n$ is identical for both chemical species ($=0.04 \text{ mol}$). 

What is the concentration of a solution when $1.461g$ of $NaCl$ is dissolved in water to make the final volume of $250.0mL$?
?
$NaCl \text{ mol}=\frac{1.461g}{58.44g'mol}=2.5 \times 10^{-2}$
$C=\frac{2.5 \times 10^{-2}}{0.250L}=0.1mol/L$

Glucose ($C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}$) has a molecular weight of 180.16, what mass of glucose would you need to dissolve in 500ml of water to get a 3M solution? :: $C=\frac{n}{V} \rightarrow 0.5L \times 3M; n=1.5 mol$; $1.5mol \times 180.16=270.24$ grams of glucose 

What mass of $CaCl_{2}$ ($M_{r}=110.98g,mol$) would be needed to prepare a $250mL$ $0.1_{M}$ $CaCl_{2}$ solution?
?
$C=\frac{n}{V} \rightarrow 0.1_{M}=\frac{n}{0.250L} \rightarrow n=0.025 \text{ mol}$
$0.025 \text{ mol} \times 110.98g,mol = 2.7745 = 2.8$ grams of $CaCl_{2}$

Given $M_{r}=110.98g,mol$, what is the mass (grams) of a $0.1_{M}$ concentration in $250mL$ solution? :: By obtaining the percent of $110.98g,mol \times 0.1_{M}=11.098$, you can obtain the mass by multiplying it by $0.25L \times 11.098 = 2.7745$ grams

What mass of $AgNO_{3}$ ($M_{r}=169.8752$) is needed to prepare 250mL of $0.0125_{M}AgNO_{3}$ solution? :: $0.0125_{M} = \frac{x}{0.250L} \rightarrow =0.003125$ mol $\times 169.8725g,mol = 0.5308515625 = 0.5308$ grams of $AgNO_{3}$

318g of Sodium carbonate is dissolved in 1500ml of water. What is the concentration in g/L? :: $C=\frac{n}{V} \rightarrow \frac{318g}{1.5L}=212g/L$
