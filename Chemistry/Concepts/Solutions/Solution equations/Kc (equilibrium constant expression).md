$aA + bB \leftrightarrow cC + dD$
$K_{c}/K_{eq}$  :: $\frac{ [C]^{c}_{eq} [D]^{d}_{eq} }{ [A]^{a}_{eq} [B]^{b}_{eq} }$
$\ce{2PCl5}$ in $K_{c}$ format :: $\ce{[PCl5]^{2}}$

What does the size of $K_{c}$ measure? :: It measures the progress of the reaction, big being more complete and small being barely started
Why do different reactions have a different $K_{c}$? :: Because as temperature changes, so can concentration
When is $K_{c}$ used? :: In reactions with solutions
What is the alternate subscript for $K_{c}$? :: $K_{eq}$

What does a high value of $K_{c}$ indicate? :: That the reaction would be virtually complete when at equilibrium

Solids and non-compound (pure elements) aren't included in the $K_{c}$ equation

What is the $K_{c}$ equation for
$\ce{2NaHSO3_{(s)} <=> Na2SO3_{(s)} + H2O_{(g)} + SO2_{(g)}}$?
?
$\ce{K_{c} = [H2O][SO2]}$


Given 3 $K_{c}$ values, 
1. $9.5 \times 10^{13}$
2. $3.6 \times 10^{20}$
3. $2.0 \times 10^{9}$
Which reaction goes furthest to completion (furthest to least furthest)?
?
Reaction 2 -> 1 -> 3


Considering $\ce{G: N2O + NO2 <=> 3NO}$ with a $\Delta H = +155.7kJmol$
