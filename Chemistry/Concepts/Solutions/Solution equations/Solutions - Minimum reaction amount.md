d. Volume in mL of $\ce{0.446M KMnO4}$ needed to react with $\ce{50.0mL of 0.200M H2C2O4}$ (with excess $\ce{H2SO4}$)
$\ce{2KMnO4 + 5H2C2O4 + 3H2SO4 -> 2MnSO4 + 10CO2_{(g)} + 8H2O + K2SO4}$
Not C1V1.. $\cancel{\ce{0.446M + 0.050L = 0.200M \times x -> 2.48L = 2480mL}}$
$\ce{H2C2O4 mol = 0.050L \times 0.200 = 0.0100 mol}$
-> $\ce{KMnO4 : H2C2O4 = 2:5}$
-> $\ce{0.01 * \frac{2}{5} = 0.004mol}$
-> $\ce{0.446M = \frac{0.004mol}{L} -> 0.00896L -> 8.97mL}$


f) Volume of $\ce{3Ca(NO3)2 + 2Na3PO4 -> Ca3(PO4)2 + 6NaNO3}$
Calcium nitrate = 0.140M, unknown volume
Sodium phosphate = 0.185M, 25.0mL
How much calcium nitrate (in mL) is needed to completely react with 25mL of sodium phosphate?
$C=\frac{n}{V}; n=CV; V=\frac{n}{C}$
NaPhosphate mol = $0.185 \times 0.025L = 0.004625$ mol
CaNitrate mol = $0.004625 \times \frac{3}{2} = 0.0069375$ mol
	3 moles of CaNitrate needs 2 moles of NaPhosphate
$V = \frac{0.0069375}{0.140M} -> 0.0495L = 49.5mL$
