Dissolution general equation :: $\ce{aA_{(s)} <=> cC_{(aq)} + dD_{(aq)}}$, 

What is the equation for the dissolution of calcium fluoride?
?
First, calcium fluoride is $\ce{CaF2}$.
The calcium fluoride is going to be surrounded by solvent particles and then separated into it's ions.
From this simple fact, we can determine that the equation will be:
$\ce{CaF2_{(s)} <=> Ca^{2+} + 2F-}$


![[Solubility#Solubility product]]

The solubility product of lead (II) sulfate at 25C is $6.3 \times 10^{-7}$. What is the molar solubility (concentration) at this temperature?
?
$\ce{PbSO4_{(s)} <=> Pb^{2+} + SO4^{2-}}$
$K_{sp} = [C]^{c} [D]^{d}$
- Solubility product of $\ce{PbSO4_{(s)}}$ = $6.3 \times 10^{-7}$
	- Is equal to $\ce{[Pb^{2+}][SO4^{2-}]}$
- Solubility product of $\ce{Pb^{2+}}$ and $\ce{SO4^{2-}}$ = $x \times x$ (unknown)
Since $\ce{Pb^{2+}}$ and $\ce{SO4^{2-}}$ combined is equal to $\ce{K_{sp}}$, finding the square root will get the molar solubility.
$\ce{K_{sp} = x^{2} -> 6.3 \times 10^{-7} = x^{2}}$
-> $\ce{x = \sqrt{6.3 \times 10^{-7}}}$
-> $\ce{x = 7.9 \times 10^{-4}}$
Therefore the molar solubility of lead (II) sulfate is $7.9 \times 10^{-4}M$
