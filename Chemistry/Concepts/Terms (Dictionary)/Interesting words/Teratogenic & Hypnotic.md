A **teratogenic** compound causes birth defects in a fetus/embryo
Thalidomide, a morning sickness drug, had this property in it's $\ce{R (-)}$ enantiomer.

A **hypnotic** compound acts as a sedative, causing sleep or a relaxed state. Thalidomide had this property in it's $\ce{S (+)}$ enantiomer.

The problem came with the manufacturing process, where it was (and still is) extremely challenging to separate the two enantiomers. The result was an equal distribution of both the $\ce{R \& S}$ enantiomers, resulting in better sleep but a baby born with severe birth defects.
