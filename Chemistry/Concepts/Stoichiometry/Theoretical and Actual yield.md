**Notes:** 
- $P_{ \text{theoretical yield} } = P_{grams}$
- The calculated values $R^{x}_{\text{test mol}}$ are used to find the limiting reagent but should only be used if the $\frac{\text{\# product}}{\text{\# limiting reagent}}$ ratio is the same as the $\frac{\text{\# limiting reagent}}{\text{\# excess reagent}}$, otherwise discard them

**What's needed**
$P_{Mr}$ - product molar mass
$R^{x}_{Mr}$ - all reactants molar masses (if limiting reagent is known, only that molar mass is needed)
$\#$ - coefficients of all products/reactants

**Method**
1. Figure out and balance the equation
2. Using the grams and molar masses ($M_{r}$) of $R^{1}$ and $R^{2}$, find the moles of each ($R^{x}_{\text{mols}}$)
3. Find the limiting reagent by dividing each $R^{x}_{\text{mols}}$ by it's coefficient ($\#R^{x}$) to find the testing molar values of each reactant, $R^{x}_{\text{test mol}}$ 
	1. With $R^{x}_{\text{test mol}}$, the lowest value means that $R^{x}_{mol}$ is the limiting reagent ($R_{lim}$), and the highest is the excess
		1. $R_{lim} = R^{x}_{mol}$
4. To find the moles of the product ($P_{mol}$), Find the molar ratio of the product to the limiting reagent ($R_{lim}$) using $P_{mol} = R_{lim} \times \frac{\#P}{\#R_{lim}}$
	1. To find the moles of the reagent, use $R^{x}_{mol} = P_{mol} \times \frac{ \#R_{lim} }{ \#P }$
	2. NOTE: If the $\frac{\text{\# product}}{\text{\# limiting reagent}}$ ratio is the same as the $\frac{\text{\# limiting reagent}}{\text{\# excess reagent}}$, the latter equation will be the same as the former, so use the latter 
5. Convert the moles of $P_{mol}$ to grams $P_{grams}$ using $P_{Mr}$ to find the theoretical yield $(P_{grams}=P_{\text{theoretical yield}})$
6. If you have the actual yield in grams, use $\%yield = \frac{P_{ \text{actual yield} }}{P_{ \text{theoretical yield}}} \times 100$ to find the percent yield
