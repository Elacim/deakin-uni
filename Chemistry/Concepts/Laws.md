Law of Conservation of Mass - no detectable gain or loss of mass occurs in chemical reactions - mass is conserved
	-> 8H + 4O -> 4H2O
Law of Definite Proportions - a 1L bottle of water will have the same proportions of H${_2}$O as a 5L bottle
Law of Multiple Proportions - multiple different compounds can contain the same elements

Only whole atoms can combine, not fractions - you won't have an atom, you'd have an explosion or a serious problem.
