Formula for ethers :: $\ce{R-O-R'}$ ($\ce{R}$s are alkyl/aryl groups) 
How is the oxygen hybridised? :: $sp^{3}$
What is the bond angle between the $\ce{O \& Cs}$? :: $109.5\degree$
What groups are ethers usually a part of? :: Alkyl or aryls

Are ethers very reactive? :: Not really, they tend to be resistant, much like hydrocarbons
Are ethers readily oxidised? :: No.
Are ethers readily reduced? :: No.
Are ethers polar? :: Moderately

Does the ether's oxygen bond only in chains? :: No, it can bond in chains or rings (e.g. one carbon of the ring replaced with an oxygen)


What are ethers good for in chemical applications? :: Being a medium for organic reactions as solvents due to their solvent ability and strongly inert nature
