#### Physical properties
See: [[Physical properties]] for a list of physical properties.

What bonds in an alcohol are always polar? :: The $\ce{C-O \& O-H}$ bonds (note: the $\ce{O}$ is the same oxygen)

What properties are greater in alcohols compared to hydrocarbons of similar molar mass? :: Significantly higher boiling points and water solubility

Alcohols join together as liquids. How? :: Through hydrogen bonding (electronegative $O$ to other alcohol hydrogens)

Why do liquid alcohols have a high boiling point? :: The hydrogen bonds they form with each other are strong and need extra energy to break 

##### Boiling point
- [[Boiling and Vapour Pressure]] 
Which of ethane or methanol has a greater boiling point? :: Methanol does at 65°C, ethane is at -89°C

###### Example
Highest to lowest boiling point
$\ce{CCCCOH > CCCCOC > CCOCC > COC}$
Alcohol > Long ester > Medium ester > Short ester

##### Solubility
Why are alcohols readily soluble in water? :: The $-OH$ group on the alcohols readily bond with the oxygen and hydrogen of the $H_{2}O$ molecules (Oxygen to hydrogen and vice versa)

How does an alcohol's size affect solubility? :: It tends to decrease as the hydrocarbon components become more prevalent

True or false: Alcohols are not soluble in water. :: False. They tend from fairly soluble to infinitely soluble.

Which of ethane or methanol has greater solubility? :: Methanol has infinite, ethane is insoluble

How is solubility affected by greater size? :: It tends to reduce (methanol to propanol are infinite, butanol is 8g/100g, and pentanol is 2.3/100g)
What can make an alcohol more soluble? :: More $\ce{-OH}$ groups - diols and triols tend to be more soluble (butan-1-ol is 8g/100g whereas butane-1,4-diol is infinite)

###### Examples
Solubility (highest is first)
$\ce{COCCOC < COC < CCCCCOH < CCCCOC}$
Double [[Esters|ester]] < Short single ester < Long alcohol < Long single ester
