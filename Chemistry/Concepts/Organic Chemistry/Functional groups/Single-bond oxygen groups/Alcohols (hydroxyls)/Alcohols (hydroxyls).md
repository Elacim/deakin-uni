[[Functional groups - Hydroxyl.png]]
What are the Alcohol R-groups? :: Carbon

| Group           | Single        | Substituent | Functional group   |
| --------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| Alcohol         | `-ol`         | `hydroxy`   | $\ce{R-OH}$        |
| Ether           | `-oxy -ane`   | `oxy`       | $\ce{R-O-R}$       |

Importance of alcohols in organic chemistry :: They allow interconversion to six other functional groups and vice versa

How is ethanol produced from grains/sugar products?
?
They are converted to the easily digestible glucose, $\ce{C6H12O6}$, directly (sugars) or indirectly (grains -> starches -> glucose) which is then converted to ethanol, $\ce{2CH3CH2OH}$, and $\ce{2CO2}$
