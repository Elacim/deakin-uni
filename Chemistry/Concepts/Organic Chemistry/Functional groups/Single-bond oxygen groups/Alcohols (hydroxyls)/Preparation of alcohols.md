What is this diagram demonstrating?
![[Alcohols (hydroxyls) - conversions to other compounds.png]]
?
That alcohols can be easily reacted to form those outer compounds and vice versa

Where does the $OH^{-}$ group come from in a alkene to alcohol reaction? :: The $H_{2}O$

**Alkene to alcohol** reaction :: $\ce{Alkene + H2O ->T[acid][catalyst] Alcohol}$
Example: $\ce{H2C=CH2 + H2O -> CH3CH2OH}$

**Haloalkane to alcohol** reaction :: $\ce{Haloalkane + H2O <-> Alcohol + (Hydrogen \& Halo)}$
Example: $\ce{(CH3)3C-Br + H2O <-> (CH3)3C-OH + HBr}$


##### [[Carbonyl (ketones)]] and [[Carbonyl (aldehydes)]]
What are ketones reduced to? :: Secondary alcohols
What are aldehydes reduced to? :: Primary alcohols

What type of reducing agent is used for carbonyl to alcohol reactions? :: Metal hydrides
What reducing agent is commonly used for ketone to alcohol reductions? :: $\ce{NaBH4}$ (sodium borohydride)
What reducing agent is commonly used for aldehyde to alcohol reductions? :: $\ce{LiAlH4}$ (lithium aluminium hydride)
Out of $\ce{NaBH4 \& LiAlH4}$, which one is the stronger reducing agent? :: The $\ce{LiAlH4}$ is

##### [[Carboxyl (carboxylic acid)]] and esters
What are carboxylic acids reduced to? :: Primary alcohols
What are esters reduced to? :: Primary alcohols

Do the carboxylic acid alcohols remain attached to the molecule? :: Yes and there is no side product
Do the ester alcohols remain attached to the molecule? :: Yes, but there is a side product primary alcohol

What reducing agent do carboxyls and esters use? :: Lithium aluminium hydride - $\ce{LiAlH4}$
###### Carboxylic acid
`oleic acid` $\ce{->T[LiAlH_{4}][H3O+]}$ `octadec-9-en-1-ol (87%)`
