Each $\ce{H}$ is replaced by a $\ce{CH3}$ group.
The most simple alcohol is `methanol` - $\ce{C(OH)(H)(H)(H)}$

Name for alcohols with two $\ce{-OH}$ groups :: Diols
Name for alcohols with three $\ce{-OH}$ groups :: Triols
###### Primary alcohol
Formula for a primary alcohol :: $\ce{C(OH)(H)(H)(CH3)}$ 
IUPAC name for the simplest primary alcohol :: `ethanol`, or `ethyl alcohol`
###### Secondary alcohol
Formula for a secondary alcohol :: $\ce{ }$ ($C$ with $2CH_{3}, 1H, OH$ attached)
IUPAC name for the simplest primary alcohol :: `propan-2-ol`, or `isopropyl alcohol`
###### Tertiary alcohol
