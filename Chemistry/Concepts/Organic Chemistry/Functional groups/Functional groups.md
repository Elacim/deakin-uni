Given $\ce{ CH3CH2OH }$, what part of this molecule will be most reactive? :: The functional group ($OH$ in this case) is generally the point of reaction in a molecule
How do functional groups differ from molecule to molecule? :: They tend to not differ, meaning they can and usually do have similar chemical behaviours

What is the most important set of groups in organic chemistry? :: The carbonyls (includes carboxylic acids) due to the carbonyl carbon being utilised in many reactions (organic and synthetic)
