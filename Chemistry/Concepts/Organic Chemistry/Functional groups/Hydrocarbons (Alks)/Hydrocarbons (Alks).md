| Group           | Single        | Substituent | Functional group   |
| --------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| Alkane          | `-one`        | `yl??`      | $\ce{R-C-R}$       |

What is a hydrocarbon? :: A molecule made purely of carbons and hydrogens
Hydride :: IUPAC name for Hydrocarbons

What is a saturated carbon? :: A carbon with all 4 bonds being only $\ce{C or H}$, no single bonds allowed
What are the saturated hydrocarbon group(s)? :: Alkanes
What are the unsaturated hydrocarbons group(s)? :: Alkenes, Alkynes, and Arenes

Why are unsaturated hydrocarbons unsaturated? :: They have less than the maximum amount of hydrogen atoms (i.e. carbons with more than one bond)

How is bonding affted
More saturated = more difficulty connecting
Less saturated = more complex bonding with other molecules

Alkane carbon-carbon bonding characteristics :: The carbons only bond singly
Why are alkanes saturated? :: They have the minimal amount of carbon bonds, allowing the maximum (most saturated) of hydrogens

Terms for describing carbon atom groups :: Primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary
What is another way of describing primary, secondary, etc. carbon atoms? :: *iso*, *sec*, *tert*, and *neo*
If a carbon atom is described as tertiary, what does this mean? :: A carbon with 3 other carbons atoms bonded to it
