What are all amines derivatives of? :: $\ce{NH_{3}}$ (ammonia)
Ammonia condensed formula :: $\ce{NH3}$
Ammonium condensed formula :: $\ce{NH4+}$
What is the hybridisation of the central $\ce{N}$? :: $sp^{3}$

What is the suffix name for amines? :: `-amine`
What is the substituent (prefix) name for amines? :: `amino`

What is the acidity of a given amine? :: Slightly basic (weak bases)
Are *all* amines weak bases? :: Yes, amine solutions too
Are amines nucleo or electrophilic? :: Nucleophilic

What do amines readily react with? :: Acids and electrophiles
What do does an amine-acid reaction form? :: Salts

Which amines are polar? :: All of them

Which amines form hydrogen bonds with other amines? :: Primary and secondary amines ([[Types of amines#Primary, secondary, and tertiary]])

Are amine hydrogen bonds strong? :: Yes, but they are weaker than intermolecular $\ce{OH--O}$ bonds due to a lower electronegativity difference
