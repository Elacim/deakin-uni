What is the acidity of a given amine? :: Slightly basic (weak bases)
Are *all* amines weak bases? :: Yes, amine solutions too
Are amines nucleo or electrophilic? :: Nucleophilic

What do does an amine-acid reaction form? :: Salts

How are amine acid-base properties often discussed? :: Referring to the conjugate acid constant $K_{a}$


##### Cyclic rings
Basicity of aromatic vs aliphatic amines :: Aromatic are significantly weaker bases than aliphatic

From most basic to least, how does `ammonia`, `aniline`, and `cyclohexylamine` rank? :: Most to least: `cyclohexylamine` ($pK_{b}=3.34$), `ammonia` ($4.74$), `aniline` ($9.36$)

Lower $pK_{b}$ means a stronger base 
What type of amine is `cyclohexylamine`? :: Aliphatic amine
What type of amine is `aniline`? :: Aromatic amine
Aniline = aromatic

#### Separation of amines from water-soluble and non-basic compounds
![[Norepinephrine amine salt.png]]
Here, we mix the `norepinephrine` molecule with $\ce{HCl \& H2O}$ to make it a more soluble in a salt form, `norepinephrine hydrochloride`
To reverse the reaction, a base like $\ce{NaOH}$ would be mixed in to turn the $\ce{HCl -> Na+Cl- + H2O}$, getting back `norepinephrine`


`aniline` is only slightly soluble in water, but a salt form of it, `aniline hydrochloride` is highly soluble.
By mixing in $\ce{HCl and H2O}$, we get this more soluble salt and avoid the water-insoluble `anisole`

#### Formation of amides from amines
https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Organic_Chemistry/Supplemental_Modules_(Organic_Chemistry)/Anhydrides/Reactivity_of_Anhydrides/Acid_Anhydrides_React_with_Amines_to_Form_Amides
What molecule types are used to form amides?
?
Acid chlorides (e.g. `benzoyl chloride`) **or**
Carboxylic anhydrides (e.g. `acetic anhydride`)

###### Acid chlorides
The `aniline`'s hydrogen from $\ce{NH2}$ pairs up with the `benzoyl chloride`'s $\ce{Cl}$ to form $\ce{HCl}$

###### Carboxylic anhydrides
The left side of the `anhydride`'s molecule $\ce{R-C(=O)}$, bonds to one of the two `amine`s to form an **amide** and a spare $\ce{H}$.
This spare $\ce{H}$ is used with the 2nd `amine` to form a positively charged `ammonia` with an $\ce{R'}$ group.
The right side of the `anhydride` is now by itself, $\ce{O-C(=O)-R}$, with the first $\ce{O}$ being negatively charged
