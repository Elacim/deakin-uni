$\ce{R-C(=O)-R}$

The carbonyl group is the most important functional group in organic chemistry

Most molecules of biological importance have the carbonyl group. 

Bonds forming to the carbonyl carbon is an important step used in many biological and synthetic reactions.

Aldehyde bonds :: $\ce{Alk-C(=O)-H}$ (one hydrocarbon group and one hydrogen)
Ketone bonds :: $\ce{Alk-C(=O)-Alk}$ (two hydrocarbon groups)

What is the geometry of a carbonyl group? :: [[Trigonal planar geometry]] 

#### Physical properties
True or false: All carbonyls are polar :: True.
Why are carbonyls polar? :: Carbonyls are always polar because of the $\ce{C=O}$ group ($3.5\chi - 2.5\chi = 1.0 > 0.5$ = polar)
$\ce{C=O}$ is a resonance structure with what? :: $\ce{C+-O-}$

Here, the carbonyl carbon and two methyls ($\ce{CH3-C-CH3}$) on this `acetone` have their $\delta ^{+}$ distributed.

#### [[Hybridisation]] 
![[Carbonyl group - hybridisation.png]]
There is a strong negative charge at the $\ce{O}$ end due to two non-bonding lone pairs

The carbon and oxygen are sigma bonded
There are two pi bonds going between the *2p* orbitals

#### Aldehyde or Ketone?
What type of carbonyl is $\ce{H-C(=O)-H}$? :: An aldehyde, known commonly as `formaldehyde` and scientifically as `methanal`
What type of carbonyl is $\ce{CH3-C(=O)-H}$? :: An aldehyde, known commonly as `acetaldehyde` and scientifically as `ethanal`

What type of carbonyl is $\ce{CH3-C(=O)-CH3}$? :: A ketone, known commonly as `acetone` and scientifically as `propanone`
What type of carbonyl is $\ce{CH3-C(=O)-CH2CH3}$? :: A ketone, known commonly as `methyl ethyl ketone` and scientifically as `butanone`
