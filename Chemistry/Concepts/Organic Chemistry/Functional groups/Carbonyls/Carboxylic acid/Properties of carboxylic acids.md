In what phase (solid/liquid/gas/plasma) do carboxylic acids need to be to bond to each other? :: Liquid or solid states

Name for carboxylic acid-carboxylic acid product :: [[Properties of carboxylic acids#Dimers|Dimers]]

#### Boiling point and solubility
Do carboxylic acids have a low boiling point? :: No, it is high to very high

##### Boiling points
How do the boiling points of carboxylic acids compare to alcohols of similar-mass? :: They are slightly-moderately higher
How do the boiling points of carboxylic acids compare to ketones/aldehydes of similar-mass? :: They are moderately-significantly higher

Boiling point wise, how would `butanoic acid` compare to `pentan-1-ol`? :: `butanoic acid` would have a higher boiling point

Why do carboxylic acids have such high boiling points? :: They are polar and form strong hydrogen bonds due to their two sites ($\ce{C=O}$ and $\ce{OH}$)
##### Solubility
How does the solubility of carboxylic acids compare to alcohols of similar-mass? :: They are generally equivalent or higher
How does the solubility of carboxylic acids compare to ketones/aldehydes of similar-mass? :: They are generally higher

Why are carboxylic acids so soluble? :: They have two sources of hydrogen bonds - their $\ce{C=O}$ and $\ce{OH}$

#### Dimers
What are dimers? :: Carboxylic acid-carboxylic acid bonding
How are dimers formed? :: Through $\ce{2(O-H-O)}$ hydrogen bonds
