How do ketones/aldehydes interact with other molecules? :: Through dipole-dipole interactions

### Boiling points and solubility
Boiling points compared to alkanes/ethers of similar molar mass? :: Higher boiling points
Solubility in water compared to alkanes/ethers of similar molar mass? :: Higher water solubility

Solubility in water of low molar mass ketones/aldehydes compared to non-polar compounds of similar molar mass? :: They are more soluble

Why are ketones/aldehydes fairly-highly soluble? :: The oxygen hydrogen bonding with water
