Which reaction produces aromatic ketones? :: The [[#Friedel-Crafts acylation]] 

#### Friedel-Crafts acylation
What occurs in a Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction?
?
Aromatic ketones are formed from a `benzene`,  `acyl halide`, and the catalyst $\ce{AlCl3}$

Basic Friedel-Crafts acylation formula :: $\ce{Benzene + Acyl halide \ce{->T[AlCl_{3}]} Aromatic ketone + HX acid}$

What type of reaction is a Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction? :: An [[Electrophilic reactions|electrophilic]] aromatic substitution 

![[Preparation of ketones-aldehydes - Friedel-Crafts acylation example.png|300]]
#### Oxidation of alcohols
What occurs in an oxidation of alcohols reaction? :: A primary/secondary alcohol is oxidised to produce a aldehyde/ketone

What does the oxidation of alcohol reaction need to produce **aldehydes**? :: A primary alcohol

What does the oxidation of alcohol reaction need to produce **ketones**? :: A secondary alcohol


Note: `PCC` is `pyridinium chlorochromate`
Alcohol + PCC = Aldehyde

#### Hydration of alkynes
When water is mixed with alkenes, what does it produce? :: An alcohol
When water is mixed with alkynes, what does it produce? :: An enol

What does an enol transform into? :: A ketone
How does an enol transform into a ketone? :: Through ![[Tautomerism|tautomerism]] 
$\ce{Butyne + H2O \ce{->} Enol <-> butanone}$

#### Ozonolysis of alkenes
Not assessed but still research a bit just in case
