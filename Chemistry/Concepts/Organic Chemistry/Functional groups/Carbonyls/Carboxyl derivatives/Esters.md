Ester formula :: $\ce{Acyl-OR}$ or $\ce{Acyl-OAr}$
![[Esters - esterification.png]]
Esters can undergo hydrolysis. More information found here:
- [[Reactions of carboxylic acids#Esters]]

True or False: Esters are less soluble than alcohols :: True as they are less polar.
#### Esterification
Esterification :: The production of an ester (usually from an alcohol + carboxylic acid)

Esterification formula :: $\ce{Carb. acid + Alcohol <=>T[H_{2}SO_{4}] Ester + H2O}$

Is esterification reversible? :: Yes, if it is catalysed by an acid

What catalytic acid does esterification use? :: $\ce{H2SO4}$ (sulphuric acid) 

#### Naming
It goes `-yl -oate`, with the `-yl` being the group bonded to the oxygen
