The hydrogen is added to the double-bonded carbon that has the most hydrogens in asymmetrical molecules


![[Markovnikov's rule - example 3.png]]
If a chlorine is added to this, it will likely go to **C** (major product) as it is the carbon with the most hydrogens attached. It going to **D** would be the minor product
**C** is attached to $\ce{CH3, CH, \& CH2}$
**D** is attached to $\ce{C, H, \& CH2}$
