### Groups
Alk :: 
Alk etymology :: It comes from remove the `-ol` from `alcohol` to form `alc = alk`

Difference between methane and methyl :: Methane is $\ce{CH4}$ whereas methyl is $\ce{-CH3}$
`-yl` :: An organic compound with one hydrogen bond missing and only single $\ce{C-C}$ bonds
`-ylidene` :: An organic compound with one hydrogen bond missing and at least one $\ce{C=C}$ bond
`-ylidyne` :: An organic compound with one hydrogen bond missing and at least one $\ce{C#C}$ bond

What does the prefix in an alkane name tell us? :: The number of carbon atoms

How many carbon atoms in `meth-` molecules? :: 1
How many carbon atoms in `eth-` molecules? :: 2
How many carbon atoms in `prop-` molecules? :: 3
How many carbon atoms in `but-` molecules? :: 4
How many carbon atoms in `pent-` molecules? :: 5
How many carbon atoms in `hex-` molecules? :: 6
How many carbon atoms in `hept-` molecules? :: 7
How many carbon atoms in `oct-` molecules? :: 8
How many carbon atoms in `non-` molecules? :: 9
How many carbon atoms in `dec-` molecules? :: 10

### Infix
| Infix | Carbon-carbon bonds in parent chain |
| ----- | ----------------------------------- |
| -an-  | all single bonds                    |
| -en-  | one or more **double** bonds        |
| -yn-  | one or more **triple** bonds        |

What does an infix tell us? :: It tells us that there is a carbon singly/doubly/triply bonded to another carbon

What does the infix `-an-` indicate? :: There is one or more singly bonded carbon ($\ce{C-C}$) in the given molecule 
What does the infix `-en-` indicate? :: There is one or more doubly bonded carbon ($\ce{C=C}$) in the given molecule 
What does the infix `-yn-` indicate? :: There is one or more triply bonded carbon ($\ce{C#C}$) in the given molecule 

### Suffixes
| Suffix    | Compound class  |
| --------- | --------------- |
| -e        | Hydrocarbon     |

| -al       | Aldehyde        |
| -one      | Ketone          |
| -oic acid | Carboxylic acid |

What do suffixes tell us? :: The class of a given compound

What is the `-e` suffix class? :: Hydrocarbon
What is the `-ol` suffix class? :: Alcohol
What is the `-al` suffix class? :: Aldehyde
What is the `-one` suffix class? :: Ketone
