Is $\ce{ -OH > -NH2 > -Br > -CH3 }$ in decreasing order of priority? :: No. It nearly is though. The `-bromo`, as it has no specific priority, is alphabetised. This means it would be after the alkyl ($\ce{CH3}$) group so the priority should instead be $\ce{ -OH > -NH2 > -CH3 > -Br }$.

Is $\ce{ -OH > -OCH3 > CH2(O)CH3 > CH2(O)OH }$ in decreasing order of priority?
?
No. The priorities would make the order: $\ce{ CH2(O)OH > CH2(O)CH3 > -OH > -OCH3 }$
(carboxylic acid > ketone > alcohol > ether)
