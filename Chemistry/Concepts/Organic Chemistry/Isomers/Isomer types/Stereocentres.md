*Stereo-* meaning :: 3-dimensions/spatial

Stereocentres aren't an atom, they are a location. It is best to think of them as an atom though.
What is a stereogenic centre? :: It is simply another name for stereocentres

What carbon-hydrogen combo can never be a stereogenic centre? :: $\ce{CH2}$ as it has 2 of the same bonds and can only have 1-2 unique groups attached. $\ce{CH3}$ can't either but $\ce{CH2}$ is more pertinent as it is likely to be analysed as a centre.

What $\ce{C to C}$ bond(s) can never be a stereocentre? :: Double or triple bonds

Stereocentres can be hybridised as... :: Either $sp^{3}$ (chiral) or $sp^{2}$ (achiral)

Stereocentres can be called chiral carbons, **even if not belonging to a chiral molecule**

Chiral centres are a subset of stereocentres
##### Chiral centres
Stereocentre in terms of a chiral molecule :: A carbon atom with 4 different groups attached to it
	Also known as a chiral carbon

These always are $sp^{3}$ hybridised and therefore can only have single bonds.

Formula for the maximum number of chiral stereoisomers  :: $2^{n}$, where $n$ is the number of stereocentres

##### Achiral centres
Stereocentre in terms of an achiral molecule :: A carbon atom with 3 different groups attached to it (with double bonds)

These are $sp^{2}$ hybridised

### Chloropentanes
Does `1-chloropentane` have any stereocentres? :: No. There are maximum of 3 unique groups found.
Does `2-chloropentane` have any stereocentres? :: Yes. The `2` carbon has $\ce{Cl, H, Me, Prop}$ groups.
Does `3-chloropentane` have any stereocentres? :: No. The seemingly best candidate, the `3` carbon, has only 3 unique groups - $\ce{H, Cl, 2(Ethyl)}$
Does `1,2-chloropentane` have any stereocentres? :: Yes, the `2` carbon has a $\ce{Cl, H, Pr, \& CH2Cl}$ group

### Misc.
Does this molecule have any stereocentres?
```smiles
CC(=O)CC
```
?
No. There are four candidates and all have too many bonds/hydrogens.

Does this molecule have any stereocentres?
```smiles
C(C)(C)C(O)C
```
?
Yes, it has one. The carbon with the $\ce{H, OH, CH3, \& CH(CH3)(CH3)}$ group.

Does this molecule have any stereocentres?
```smiles
CCC(=O)O
```
?
No. There are not four unique groups on any atom. The one that seems like it does at first glance is the carbon with the $\ce{OH, CH2, \& O}$. 
It isn't this one as the oxygen is double bonded, therefore making it only 3 unique groups.

Does this molecule have any stereocentres?
