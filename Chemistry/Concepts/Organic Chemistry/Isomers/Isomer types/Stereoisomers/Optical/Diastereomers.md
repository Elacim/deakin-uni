Diastereomers are... :: Non-mirrorable and non-identical molecule
Even if not mirrored, diastereomers are not identical molecules.
A diastereomer has it's wedges/dashes (it's atom's positions, think cis-trans) changed (but not all!) compared to the comparison isomer  
![[Diastereomers comparison.png|200]]

They often have differing [[Physical properties]] and chemical reactivity.

[May be described as syn/anti or erythro/threo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastereomer)

To find a new diastereomer of a molecule that has wedges and dashes, simply flip the wedges/dashes to find a few versions.
	You can flip all but one
		If all are flipped, it may be an enantiomer or meso compound


True or false: `cis-2-bromocyclohexanol` has `trans-2-bromocyclohexanol` as a diastereomer :: True
