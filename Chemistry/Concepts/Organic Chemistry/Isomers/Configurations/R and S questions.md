What is the R/S of this molecule? ![[R and S configuration - Problem 1.png|100]]
?
![[R and S configuration - Solution 1.png|100]] $\ce{Br > Cl > CH3}$, going clockwise so this molecule is $R$


What is the R/S of this molecule? :: ![[R and S configuration - Problem 2 (achiral, no solution).png|100]] This molecule is achiral (all four groups aren't different) and therefore has no $R/S$

What is the R/S of this molecule? ![[R and S configuration - Problem 3.png|100]]
?
![[R and S configuration - Solution 3.png|100]] By rotating the molecule clockwise, the low-priority hydrogen is now is the back. The priority is $\ce{OH -> CN -> CH2NH2}$
```
C|N
C|HHNHH
The first point of difference is the nitrogen, so CN > CH2NH2
```

What is the R/S of this molecule? ![[R and S configuration - Problem 4.png|100]]
?
![[R and S configuration - Solution 4.png|100]]. It is $\ce{COH -> CH2OH -> CCH}$
```
First point - all are the same (3 carbons)
First point of difference:
C|OH     C is the same, Oxygen is the next best, so COH is first
C|HHOH      
C|CH  

Don't include the last point of difference in the next comparisons

Second point of difference:
H|HOH  ->    H|OH
C|H    ->    H|-
O is greater than -, so CH2OH is second
```

What is the R/S of this molecule? ![[180px-L-serine-skeletal.png|150]]
?
There are four different groups so it is chiral and therefore has has an R/S configuration. 
The carbon in the centre has $\ce{H, NHH, COOH, \& CHHOH}$ groups. 
The $\ce{COOH}$ group is highest priority, $\ce{CHHOH}$ next, then $\ce{NHH}$. This is in a counter-clockwise (left) fashion, so it is S-configuration.

What is the R/S of this molecule? ![[(S)-Carvone.svg.png]]
?
There are four different groups, so it is chiral and has an R/S.
The carbon is attached to $\ce{H, CHCHHCHHH, CHHCOC, \& CHHCHC}$
The $\ce{CHC...}$ group (isopropenyl) is the highest priority.
The $\ce{CHHCOC}$ group next, and the $\ce{CHHCHC}$ last.
These go anti-clockwise (left), so it is the S-configuration.
