`(Z)-2,7-dimethylocta-1,3,6-triene`


![[E,Z system - example 1.png]]
The species of one side of the $\ce{C=C}$ bond cannot be the same 
	1st carbon to a methyl and ethyl is fine, but 1st carbon to a methyl and methyl isn't
...but the two sides can have the same groups
	1st carbon to a methyl and ethyl AND a 2nd carbon to a methyl and ethyl is fine

When deciding how to name, start from the double bond. Each side of the carbon double bond is a new high/low comparison
C3:
	C2-C1 is ethyl
	C3 has methyl and the C2-C1 ethyl group 
C4:
	C4 has a single H
	C5-8 is an alkyl group


#### Steps
1. Establish the atom priorities (atomic number)
	1. $\ce{ F > CH2OH }$  ($9 > 6$)
2. If atoms are in common, pick the group with the most atoms
	1. e.g. $\ce{CH2CH3 > CH3}$  ($12=12$)
3. Consider double/triple bonds as recursive (e.g. $\ce{ C#NH -> NHC(NH)NH}$) for priority identification
4.
