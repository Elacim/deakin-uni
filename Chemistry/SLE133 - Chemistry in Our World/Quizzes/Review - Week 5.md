- The number of valence electrons increases as you go from left to right across a period.
- Metallic character increases as you go from top to bottom down a group.
- Nonmetallic character increases as you go from left to right across a period.
- The size of atoms decreases as you go from left to right across a period.

Anions are larger than the neutral atoms because the new electrons cause new electron-electron repulsions that expand the orbitals.
