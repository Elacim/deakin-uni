A compound is found to contain 59.9% carbon, 32.0% oxygen and the remainder hydrogen.
What is the empirical formula of this compound?
Write your answer with no spaces. You do not need to use subscripts. Make sure that you follow the rules for the order of elements in a chemical formula taught in week 2.

91.9% C and O $\therefore$ 8.1% hydrogen



How much $NH_{3}$ will be formed if 5.675 mol of $H_{2}$ is used in the following chemical reaction: $N_{2} + 3H_{2} → 2NH_{3}$
1:3->2
$H_{2}$ = $2(1.0079)=2.0158$ g/mol
$\frac{5.675 mol}{3 \text{ H}}=1.89167$ mol, $\frac{1.89167mol}{2}=0.9458$ mol



Calculate the amount (in mols) of a solution of NaOH with a concentration of 0.208 mol/L and volume of 0.665 L
$C=\frac{n}{V}$
$\frac{0.208 \times 40.0079}{0.665L}=12.514$ mol
The correct answer is: 0.138


What is the concentration in mol/L of a solution prepared by adding 12.8 g of sodium chloride to 75.5 mL of water?
$C=\frac{n}{V}$
$C=\frac{12.8/59.439}{\frac{75.5}{1000}}=2.85$ mol/L

How much $NH_{3}$ will be formed if 4.49 mol of H2 is used in the following chemical reaction: $N_2 + 3 H_2 → 2 NH_3$
$3H_{2}$ -> $4.49H_2$; $\frac{4.49}{3}=1.4967 \times$ increase
$2 \times 1.4967=2.9933$
