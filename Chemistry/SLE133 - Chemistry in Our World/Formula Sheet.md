### Common units
1 atm = Atmospheric pressure
$Pa$ = Pascals ($\div 1000$ to get $kPa$)
$Pa$ = $N$ $m^{-2}$ (Newtons/square meter)
$kPa$ = Kilopascals  ($\times 1000$ to get $Pa$)
$Pa \rightarrow$ atmospheres = $\frac{Pa}{101325}$
Atmospheres $\rightarrow Pa$ = $atm \times 101,325$

$L$ = Litres  ($\rightarrow m^{3} = \frac{L}{1000}$)
$m^{3}$ = Meters cubed  ($\rightarrow L = m^{3} \times 1000$)
$dm^{3}$ = Decimetres cubed, equal to $1L$
There are $1000L$ $(dm^{3})$ in $1m^{3}$ 

$J$ = Joules ($\rightarrow kJ = \frac{J}{1000}$)
$kJ$ = Kilojoules ($\rightarrow J = kJ \times 1000$)

$cm^{3}$ = Centimetres

$K$ = Kelvin ($\rightarrow C° = K - 273.15$)
$C°$ = Celsius ($\rightarrow K = C° + 273.15$)

### Constants
Room temperature = $25C°$
Atmospheric pressure = $1.01325 \times 10^5$ $Pa$  OR $101,325$ $Pa$ OR $101.325$ $kPa$ OR $1$ atm
- Atmosphere = $78.08\%N:20.95\%O:0.93\%Ar:0.04\%Misc$
Gas constant $R$ = $8.31446$ $J \text{ mol}^{-1} K^{-1}$ (joules per mol per kelvin) OR $8.31466 \text{ m}^{3} Pa \text{ mol}^{-1}K^{-1}$

**STP** = Standard room temperature and (atmospheric) pressure


### The Big Three formulas
###### Ideal Gas Law
$PV=nRT$
- $P$ = Pressure ($Pa$ if $m^{3}$ otherwise $kPa$ if $L$) - often atmospheric pressure
- $V$ = Volume ($m^{3}$ if $Pa$ otherwise $L$ if $kPa$)
- $n$ = Moles (mol)
- $R$ = Gas constant = $8.31446$ (0.0)
- $T$ = Temperature (Kelvin)
**- Variations -**
$P = \frac{nRT}{V}$
$V = \frac{nRT}{P}$
$n = \frac{PV}{RT}$
$T = \frac{PV}{nR}$
**- Examples -** 
- $n=\frac{ 101,325Pa \times 0.032m^{3} }{8.3145 \times 300K}$
- $T = \frac{ 101.325kPa \times 7.2L }{2mol \times 8.3145}$

The oxidation of nitrogen oxide produces nitrogen dioxide, as shown below:
2NO (g) + O2 (g) → 2NO2 (g)
If 0.309 moles of NO (g) and 0.144 moles of O2 (g) are reacted in a 2.50 m3 vessel at 298K, how many moles of NO2 gas will be produced?
NO2 moles = limiting reagent moles
2NO/2 = 0.309/2 = 0.1545 mol
1O2/1 = 0.144/1 = 0.144 mol
Since there are two nitrogen dioxides being made, `limiting reagent (0.144) * product coefficient (2) = 0.288`

###### Concentration/Molar/Particle counts
$C=\frac{n}{V}$ | $n=\frac{m}{M_{r}}$ | $n=\frac{N}{N_{A}}$
- $C$ = $\text{mol}/L$ OR $_{M}$, known as Molarity
- $n$ = $\text{moles}$
- $V$ = Volume ($L$ a.k.a. $dm^{3}$)
- $m$ = mass in grams
- $M_{r}$ = molar mass (g/mol) and the atomic mass on the periodic table

### Gas Laws
**Boyle's Law:** As pressure increases, volume decreases (if at a constant temperature) - pressure is inversely proportional to volume
$P_{1}V_{1}=P_{2}V_{2}$

**Charles' Law:** As volume increases, temperature increases (if at a constant pressure) - volume is proportional to temperature
$\frac{V_{1}}{T_{1}}=\frac{V_{2}}{T_{2}}$

**Gay-Lussac's Law:** As pressure increases, temperature increases (if at a constant volume) - 
$\frac{P_{1}}{T_{1}} = \frac{P_{2}}{T_{2}}$

**Combined gas law:** Remove any variables that are constant (e.g. if $T_{1}$ is equal to $T_{2}$, remove that from the equation)
$\frac{P_{1}V_{1}}{T_{1}}= \frac{P_{2}V_{2}}{T_{2}}$

Alternative gas constant for use in $PV=nRT$: $0.082057L \text{ atm mol}^{-1}K^{-1}$
- $P$ must be in atmospheres
- $V$ must be in Litres


$R_{grams}$ grams of reactant ($R$) burns in unlimited air and produces $P_{grams}$ grams of product ($P$). What is the theoretical/percent yield?
$\text{coefficient of } R$ or $P$ is a $\#$
(coefficient of a reactant/product is $_{c}$)
$R \times \frac{ \#R }{ R_{M_{r}} }$ $\times \frac{\#P}{\#X} \times \frac{ P_{M_{r}} }{ \#R }$ $= \text{ theoretical yield}$

### Limiting reagent, percent composition, empirical/molecular formulas
**Unknown Limiting Reagent - find how much can be made**
$L_{mol}$ = limiting reagent
$E_{mol}$ = excess reagent

Calculate moles of the limiting reactants (find moles then divide by the ratio):
$R_{mol} = \frac{R_{grams}}{ R_{Mr} \times \#R }$
- Lowest $R_{mol}$ is the limiting reagent ($L_{mol}$) and the highest, excess reagent ($E_{mol}$)
- As the ratio is already accounted for, $L_{mol}$ is therefore the maximum amount of moles the reaction can produce with the given quantities.
$E_{grams} \text { \& } L_{grams} = L_{mol} \times L_{Mr}$


**Percentage composition** - the weights of each element as a percentage of the whole molecule
$N_{2}O_{4}$
$N_{2}M_{r} = 2(14.007) = 28.014$
$O_{4}M_{r} = 4(15.999) = 63.996$
Total weight = $28.014 + 63.996 = 92.01M_{r}$
$N_{2}\% = \frac{28.014}{92.01} = 30.45\%$
$O_{4}\% = \frac{63.996}{92.01} = 69.55\%$

**Molecular formula from percentages and total $M_{r}$** 
$66.07\%C : 13.54\%O : 8.53\%H : 11.85\%N$; $M_{r}=236u$
$\frac{0.6607 \times 236u}{12.011}=12.9818666223 = 13C$
$\frac{0.1354 \times 236}{16.0} = 1.99715 = 2O$
$\frac{0.0853 \times 236}{1.008} = 19.9710 = 20H$
$\frac{0.1185 \times 236}{14.006} = 1.996715 = 2N$
Final: $C_{13}H_{20}N_{2}O_{2}$


**Empirical formula from percentages**
Ethanol: $C=52.14\%$, $H=13.13\%$, and $O=34.73\%$
Treat the percentages as grams (e.g. 52.14% = 52.14 grams)
$\frac{52.14g}{12.011M_{r}}=4.341$ mol of $C$
$\frac{13.13g}{1.0079M_{r}} = 13.026$ mol of $H$ 
$\frac{34.73g}{15.999M_{r}}= 2.171$ mol of $O$ 
Ratio:
	$4.341 : 13.026 : 2.171$
Divide each number in the ratio by the smallest mole count ($2.171$ in this case) 
$\frac{4.341}{2.171} = C_{2}$  (2 moles of carbon per oxygen)
$\frac{13.026}{2.171} = H_{6}$  (6 moles of hydrogen per oxygen)
$\frac{2.171}{2.171} = O_{1}$  (1 mole of oxygen per oxygen - we're treating this is 100% and the rest as higher multiple of it)
The empirical formula is therefore $C_{2}H_{6}O$

Find the percentage with the:
$X\% = \frac{ X \text{ }M_{r} }{ \text{ total M}_{r} }$ -> $\text{ total M}_{r} = \frac{ X \text{ }M_{r} }{ X\% }$


**Formula types**
Molecular formula: $C_{9}H_{24}O_{9}$
Empirical formula: $C_{3}H_{8}O_{3}$
Condensed formula: $CH_{3}CH_{2}CH_{3}H_{16}(CO)_{6}OO_{2}$
Structural formula: Shows all the atoms and bonds of a molecule using element names and single/double/triple lines

### Periodic table trends
Periods - rows - horizontal
Groups - columns - vertical

**Size**
- Increases down groups in the periodic table
- Decreases across periods
- Smaller distance between atoms leads to a higher bond strength ($H-F$ > $H-Br$)
	- As bond length goes down, bond strength goes up
- Large molecules tend to have greater intermolecular strength due to the high prevalence of and opportunities for van der Waals forces due to electron densities

**Electronegativity ($\chi$)** tends to increase from bottom to top and left to right
- Hydrogen is highly electronegative though
- Noble gases are generally not electronegative (except $Kr$ and $Xe$)

**Ionisation energy** (eV)
- Increases left to right (within a period) due to valence shell stability
- Decreases top to bottom (with a group) due to electron shielding
- The bigger an atom, the less connected they are to their electrons (and therefore eV decreases)
- Noble gases are the most stable and therefore need more energy to lose their electrons
- The higher the energy, the harder it is for that element to become a cation

**Electron affinity**
- Increases left to right (decrease in atomic radius)
- Decreases top to bottom (increase in atomic radius)
- the ability of an element to accept an electron (more negative = higher affinity)
- Group 17 has the highest electron affinity
- Group 16 and 14 have the second highest (roughly half the affinities of group 17's elements) 
- 

**Melting/boiling point**
- Transition metals have the highest
- Carbon is a major exception, reaching melting/boiling points higher than a fair chunk of metals
- Affected by the strength of intermolecular bonds

**Density** ($g/cm^{3}$)
- Transition metals have the highest densities
	- Hafnium (72) through to Gold (79) and Palladium (91) to Plutonium (94) have the highest densities

**Electron shielding/Screening**
- Valence electrons shield the atom's outer electrons from the attractive force of the nucleus by repelling them away
- Decreases ionisation energy and electronegativity
	- Valence electrons are easier to remove than core electrons
- Increases atomic radii

#### Electron counts
Groups 1-3: $+1..+3$
Group 13: $+3$
Groups 15-17: $-3..-1$


### Reaction types
**Combustion:** $(l) + (g) \rightarrow (g) + (g)$
- $C_{7}H_{16 (l)} + 11O_{2 (g)} \rightarrow 7CO_{2 (g)} + 8H_{2}O_{(g)}$
**Acid-base:**
- $3NaOH_{(aq)} + 3H_{3}PO_{4 (aq)} \rightarrow Na_{3}(PO_{4})_{3 (aq)} + 6H_{2}O$
**Redox:**
- $Zn_{(s)}+ O_{2(g)} \rightarrow ZnO_{2 (s)}$ ($Zn$ is oxidised, $O_{2}$ is reduced)
**Precipitation:** $(aq)+(aq)\rightarrow (s)+(aq)$
- $Ba(NO_{3})_{2 (aq)} + Na_{2}SO_{4 (aq)} \rightarrow BaSO_{4 (s)} + 2NaNO_{3 (aq)}$

Sublimation state changes :: $(s)\rightarrow(g)$
Deposition state changes :: $(g) \rightarrow (s)$
Condensation state change: $(g) \rightarrow (l)$

| $X_{mol}$                        | Moles of X                |
Notes: 
- $P_{ \text{theoretical yield} } = P_{grams}$
- The calculated values $R^{x}_{\text{test mol}}$ are used to find the limiting reagent but should only be used if the $\frac{\text{\# product}}{\text{\# limiting reagent}}$ ratio is the same as the $\frac{\text{\# limiting reagent}}{\text{\# excess reagent}}$, otherwise discard them

**What's needed**
$P_{Mr}$ - product molar mass
$R^{x}_{Mr}$ - all reactants molar masses (if limiting reagent is known, only that molar mass is needed)
$\#$ - coefficients of all products/reactants

1. Figure out and balance the equation
2. Using the grams and molar masses ($M_{r}$) of $R^{1}$ and $R^{2}$, find the moles of each ($R^{x}_{\text{mols}}$)
3. Find the limiting reagent by dividing each $R^{x}_{\text{mols}}$ by it's coefficient ($\#R^{x}$) to find the testing molar values of each reactant, $R^{x}_{\text{test mol}}$ 
	1. With $R^{x}_{\text{test mol}}$, the lowest value means that $R^{x}_{mol}$ is the limiting reagent ($R_{lim}$), and the highest is the excess
		1. $R_{lim} = R^{x}_{mol}$
4. To find the moles of the product ($P_{mol}$), Find the molar ratio of the product to the limiting reagent ($R_{lim}$) using $P_{mol} = R_{lim} \times \frac{\#P}{\#R_{lim}}$
	1. To find the moles of the reagent, use $R^{x}_{mol} = P_{mol} \times \frac{ \#R_{lim} }{ \#P }$
	2. NOTE: If the $\frac{\text{\# product}}{\text{\# limiting reagent}}$ ratio is the same as the $\frac{\text{\# limiting reagent}}{\text{\# excess reagent}}$, the latter equation will be the same as the former, so use the latter 
5. Convert the moles of $P_{mol}$ to grams $P_{grams}$ using $P_{Mr}$ to find the theoretical yield $(P_{grams}=P_{\text{theoretical yield}})$
6. If you have the actual yield in grams, use $\%yield = \frac{P_{ \text{actual yield} }}{P_{ \text{theoretical yield}}} \times 100$ to find the percent yield



### Calculating yields - example (don't use)
30g of $C_{3}H_{8}$ (propane) burns in the air to produce 70g of $CO_{2}$. What is the theoretical and percent yield? 
1. Read the question to find the known and unknown variables (reactants, products, actual yields etc.)
	1. If the limiting reagent is known, skip step 3.1
2. Find what type of equation it is (combustion, precipitation, acid-base etc.)
3. From the type, write out the equation, then balance it
	1. From this, you can calculate the $\frac{ \text{product} }{ \text{reactant} }$ ratio (flipped if you're trying to find the reactant moles)
		1. Like $5O_{2} \rightarrow 10O$ would be $\frac{10O}{5O_{2}}$, and $\frac{5O_{2}}{10O}$ to get the flipped result
4. Calculate the molar mass ($M_{r}$) then convert this to moles (mol)
	1. reactant(s) moles
	2. product(s) moles
5. Multiply the reactant moles $\frac{ \text{product} }{ \text{reactant} }$ ratio and the product moles by the $\frac{ \text{reactant} }{ \text{product} }$ ratio
	1. Whatever is the lowest is the limiting reagent
6. The limiting reagent moles is the theoretical yield. Using the product's $M_{r}$, calculate the amount in grams.
7. Find the percent yield with the equation $\%yield = \frac{ \text{actual yield (grams)} }{ \text{theoretical yield (grams)} }$
	1. e.g. $\frac{ 34.52 \text {g of } CO_{2} }{ 70 \text {g of } CO_{2} } = 0.4931 \xrightarrow{\times 100} 49.31\%$



### Acids and bases
- Strong bases and acids completely dissociate
- Weak bases: $>7..10$ pH
- Weak acids: $4..7<$ pH

- Acids are proton donors
- Bases are proton acceptors

[[Acids-and-bases-chart-SigmaAldrich.jpg]]

**Water is weird**
- Water is amphoteric (can act as a Bronsted-Lowry acid/base)
Base: $H_{2}O$ accepts a proton, becoming $H_{3}O^{+}$
$HSO^{-}_{4(aq)} + H_{2}O_{(aq)} \leftrightarrow SO^{2-}_{4(aq)} + H_{3}O^{+}_{(aq)}$
Acid: $H_{2}O$ donates it's proton to become $OH^{-}$
$CH_{3}NH_{2 (aq)} + H_{2}O_{(l)} \leftrightarrow CH_{3}NH^{+}_{3(aq)} + OH^{-}_{(aq)}$
Neither: No change in electron counts so no protons were moved. It would be a medium for the reaction.

**Primary formulas**
- $pH=-log([H_{3}O^{+}])$
- $pOH=-log([OH^{-}])$
- $14= pH + pOH$
$K_{w}= 1.0 \times 10^{14}$


**Dissociation constants:**
- $K_{a}=\frac{ [H_{3}O^{+}][A^{-}] }{ [HA] }$
- $K_{b}=\frac{ [HB^{+}][OH^{-}] }{ [B] }$ or $K^{'}_{b}=\frac{ [HA][OH^{-}] }{ [A^{-}] }$
- $K_{w} = K_{a}K_{b}^{'}$

- $pK_{a} = -log(K_{a})$ and $K_{a}=10^{-pKa}$
- $pK_{b} = -log(K_{b})$ and $K_{b}=10^{-pKb}$



25mL $HNO_{3}$ titrated against 21.35mL $KOH$ solution w/ concentration of 0.155M
$HNO_{3} + KOH \rightarrow H_{2}O + KNO_{2}$
$n(KOH)=0.155 \times 0.02135 = 0.00330925M$
Since it's a 1:1 ratio,
$C=\frac{0.00330925M}{0.025L}=0.13237$

In a titration of a 20mL sample of lactic acid ($CH_{3}CHOHCOOH$) with sodium hydroxide ($NaOH$), it was found that 17.25mL of 0.155M $NaOH$ was required to reach the equivalence point. How much lactic acid was in the sample in grams?
?
$CH_{3}CHOHCOOH + NaOH \rightarrow CH_{3}CHOHCOONa + H_{2}O$
C: x and 0.155M
V: 20mL and 17.25mL
$C_{1} \times 20mL = 0.155M \times 17.25mL=0.13368$ moles
Lactic acid g/mol = 90.0786, $\times 0.13368 = 12.042$ grams

What is the acid, base, conjugate base, and conjugate acid in: $CH_{3}NH_{2} + H_{2}O \rightarrow CH_{3}NH_{3}^{+} + OH^{-}$
?
Acid: $CH_{3}NH_{2}$
Conjugate acid: $OH^{-}$
Base: $CH_{3}NH_{3}^{+}$
Conjugate base: $CH_{3}NH_{3}^{+}$

A 15mL sample of $HNO_{3}$ is titrated against a 0.180 mol/L ($_M$) $KOH$ solution. 19.82ml of $KOH$ is required to reach the endpoint. Calculate the $HNO_{3}$ concentration.
?
$HNO_{3} + KOH \rightarrow KNO_{3} + H_{2}O$
$C_{1} \times 0.015mL = 0.180_M \times 0.01982mL$
$C_{1}=0.238_M$

### Naming
[[PAI - Naming polyatomic ions]]

### Thermodynamics
Open system :: Can gain/lose mass/energy across their boundaries
Closed system :: Can absorb/release energy, but not mass, across the boundary
Isolated system :: Cannot exchange matter/energy with surroundings
Exergonic :: Energy into surroundings
Endergonic :: Energy needed from surroundings
- A spontaneous process is $-\Delta G$ and does not need external aid; exergonic
- A non-spontaneous process is $+\Delta G$ and needs external aid; endergonic

**Lingo**
$q$ = heat - the heat that is transferred to or from the system
- Can be $q_{p}$ if external pressure is constant
	-  $q_{p} = \Delta H$
$w$ = work - the work done on or by the system
- $+ve$ = energy in; $-ve$ = energy out

- **Extensive properties** are dependent on the size of a sample
- **Intensive properties** are the same, regardless of sample size
- Most reactions are performed under constant pressure

**Heat**
$q = C \times \Delta T$
$C$ = heat capacity in joules kelvin

$C_{m} = \frac{C}{n}$
- molar heat capacity of a substance = heat capacity over moles
- $C_{m}$, or molar heat, is in joules/mol/kelvin


**Work**
$w = -p \times \Delta V$
	- work in $J/L$ = -(pressure in pascals) $\times$ the change in volume ($L$)
	- Divide by $1000$ to get the total number of Joules

**Change in internal energy**
- $\Delta U / \Delta E$
- $\Delta U = q + w$
- State function, where $q$ and $w$ can be in any position and the same result is reached

**Enthalpy**
$\Delta H$ (change in heat flow, $\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$)
	Can be $\Delta_{r}H$
$\Delta H = q_{p}$
$\Delta H < 0$ = exothermic (energy released)
$\Delta H > 0$ = endothermic (energy absorbed)

**Entropy** - [[SLE133 - Chemistry in Our World/Weeks/Week 9 - Chemical Thermodynamics/Week 9 - Notes#Entropy]]
$\Delta S$ (change in entropy, $\text{J/mol/K}$)
- $\Delta S = S_{products} - S_{reactants}$ (J/mol/K)
- State function
- Solids = low entropy, gases = high entropy

$S_{total} = - \frac{H_{vap}}{T} + S_{vap}$    $\S$
- Convert $\Delta H(H_{vap})$ to joules
- $S_{total}$ and $S_{vap}$ is in Joules/mol
	e.g. =$- \frac{ 5.72kJ \times 1000 }{ 23.3°C + 273.15 } + 274J = 254.705 = 255J/K/mol$

**Gibb's Free Energy**
- $\Delta G = \Delta H - (T \times \Delta S)$
	Not sure: $G(p,T) = U + pV - (TS) = H - (TS)$
- kJ/mol
- Make sure $H$ and (especially) $S$ are in kJ/mol, not J/mol
	- And be careful to add negatives, it leads to completely different answers if needed and you go without them (not a simple sign flip)
$\Delta G < 0$ = spontaneous
$\Delta G > 0$ = **non**-spontaneous
$\Delta G = 0$ = at equilibrium
When $\Delta H$ and $\Delta S$ have the same sign (+ or -), the value of $T$ determines $\Delta G$ 
Solving for temperature $\frac{\Delta G - \Delta H}{\Delta S} = T$

##### Questions
Vaporisation of an element at 23.3°C has the enthalpy values of $H_{vap}=5.72kJ$ and $S_{vap}=274JKmol$. What is the total entropy change ($S_{total}$) in Joules/Kelvin/Mol?
$\frac{5.72kJ}{23.3C+273.15} = 0.01929$
$0.01929kJ - 274kJ = -273.98071 = 0.2739kJ$

$S = \frac{H_{vap}}{Kelvin}$

A reaction has values ΔS = 61.2 J K mol-1 and ΔH = 42.4 kJ mol-1. At what temperature (in °C) will this reaction become spontaneous?
$\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S$
kJ/mol = kJ/mol - Kelvin \* J/mol/K
-> $\Delta G - \Delta H = -T\Delta S$
-> $-\frac{\Delta G - \Delta H}{\Delta S} = T$
$\Delta S \rightarrow kJ = \frac{61.2J}{1000}=0.0612kJ$
$-(\frac{0 - 42.4kJ \Delta H}{0.0612kJ \Delta S} + 273.15) = 419.6605°C$

How much work is done when a piston is compressed from 7.46 L to 4.33 L under constant atmospheric pressure (1.013 x 10^5 Pa)? Give your answer in joules.
$(1.013 \times 10^{5}Pa) \times (4.33L-7.46L) = 317069J/L$ $\rightarrow \div 1000 = 317.069J$
(note: Pascals is 1:1 with joules)

### Solutions and solubility
$C=\frac{n}{V}$
$C_{1}V_{1}=C_{2}V_{2}$

[[Hetero and homogeneous mixtures]]
**Solution:** Homogenous mixture where two+ substances' atoms/molecules/ions/electrons can move and recombine

	Solid alloys like Bronze are too
**Solvent:** The (usually) liquid that dissolves the solute (most frequent is water)
**Solute:** The substance that is dissolved into the solvent
**Solute** $\xrightarrow{\text{dissolved in}}$ **Solvent**: Dissolution

Polar solutes dissolve in polar solvents (e.g. sugar in water)
Non-polar solutes dissolve in non-polar solvents
Polar solutes do NOT dissolve in non-polar solvents
	Ionic solids/very polar molecules like sugar can't dissolve in non-polar solvents
	This is due to the non-polar solvents being unable to attract the ions/molecules due to low polarisability

Page 588 - solubility, pockets of gas, enthalpies

$Na^{+}Cl^{-}$ is dissolved as water pulls on it. The positive side of $H_{2}O$ (the hydrogens) take $Na^{+}$ while the negative side of $H_{2}O$ takes the $Cl^{-}$. Hydration shells (hydration)

Things dissolve when the electrostatic forces and intramolecular forces are overcome.

### Inter/Intramolecular Forces - [[W8 - Flashcards#3 primary intermolecular forces]]

Van Der Waal forces - London Dispersion and dipolar forces
Dispersion/London forces - ever present forces between molecules/atoms/substances/ions etc. - [[W8 - Flashcards#Dispersion forces]]
Dipole-dipole, dipolar forces - stronger polar forces
Hydrogen bonds - strongest bonds between hydrogen and a highly charged ion (most frequently between $F$, $O$, or $N$), lone electron pair?

Intermolecular forces :: Forces between nearby atoms, ions, or molecules that repel and attract
Intramolecular forces :: Forces that repel and attract atoms that act between atoms such as covalent, ionic, or metallic bonding

### Random terms
An **Induced dipole** is triggered within a different atom when a **spontaneous dipole** form in an atom.



### Bonding
**Ionic compounds**
Metal cations and non-metal anions forming an overall neutral compound
Naming: cation then anion
- Always polar

**Covalent**
Left-to-right on the periodic table then in groups, lowest to highest (for naming) 
When an element is in groups 13-15, Hydrogen is listed last (exceptions are water, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid - and more!)
- Can be polar ($H_2O$)or non-polar ($CO_{2}$)

**Organic**
Carbon then Hydrogen then left to right
Covalently bonded compounds that contain primarily carbon and hydrogen 


### Electron rules
[[W3 - Flashcards]]

Cations vs anion size :: Cations are always smaller and anions larger than the corresponding neutral atom. This is because cations will be at a previous shell and anions at the next and positive charge shrinks the atom.

What does electron spin correspond to? :: Magnetic properties of an atom. Unpaired electrons mean a non-net-zero spin and is therefore paramagnetic.
Paramagnetic :: The amount of magnetism an atom displays; proportional to the number of unpaired electrons (e.g. $Fe$'s d-shell' has a `^ ^ ^ ^ ^`  spin, so the net spin is ($5 \times +\frac{1}{2}$)
What blocks out of ${s, p, d, f}$ are more likely to be diamagnetic? :: $s \text{ and } p$
What blocks out of ${s, p, d, f}$ are more likely to be paramagnetic? :: $d \text{ and } f$



Aufbau principle description :: Describes how [[Orbitals|orbitals]] are filled as the number of electrons in an atom increase; directly leads to the [[Periodic Table trends and structure|structure of the periodic table]] 

Aufbau Principle rules
??
1. Each electron occupies the most stable energy level (shell/$n$)
2. No two electrons can have the exact same [[Quantum numbers|quantum numbers]] 

Hund's First Rule (Rule of Maximum Multiplicity. )
??
1. Every orbital in a sublevel is singly occupied before any orbital is doubly occupied.
2. All of the electrons in singly occupied orbitals have the same spin (to maximize total spin).

### Light - [[W2 - Flashcards]]

$E=mc^{2}$
$E=hv=\frac{hc}{\lambda}$
$c=\lambda v$

The four characteristics of light ::: Frequency ($v$), Wavelength (**$\lambda$**), Amplitude, and Phase
Frequency of light ::: Number of crests/maximums passing a point in space in Hz ($v$)
Wavelength of light ::: Distance between crests/maximums ($\lambda$)
Amplitude of light ::: Max displacement of a wave from the centre
Phase of light ::: The changing of the start/end point of a wave by shifting it left/right
The Frequency and Wavelength of light is inversely proportional to each other
What characteristic of light determines the intensity? ::: Amplitude
What is the speed of light ($c$)? :: $2.998*10{^8}$ $m/s^{–1}$
Does wavelength or frequency impact the speed of light? :: No. All electromagnetic radiation travels at the speed of light, $c$
Can light be considered a particle and a wave? :: True.

Photon energy formulas
??
$E=hv$
$E=\frac{hc}{\lambda}$
$E$=Photon energy; $h$=Planck constant; $f/v$=photon frequency
$c$=speed of light in a vacuum; and $\lambda$=photon wavelength

Each photon's energy = planck's constant \* photon's frequency
Or -> freq * speed of light \\ wavelength
Lambda = wavelength in meters
N nu (Greek nu) = frequency in Hz
Light moves at 2.998
##### Particle properties of light
Photoelectric effect -> when a light is shone on metal, it produces electrons and can complete a circuit
Below a certain freq, no electrons are emitted
Higher freq = electron energy increases linearly

## States
#### Types of solids - [[W8 - Flashcards#Solids]]
MAMIN - Molecular, amorphous, metallic, ionic, and network
- Slowly cooling pure liquids until it solidifies into a crystalline solid

**Molecular solids** - covalent; soft crystals that melt at low temperatures; doesn't conduct; evaporates easy

**Amorphous** - non-crystalline solids

**Metallic solids** - electrons are delocalised (sea of electrons); 
- ductile, lustrous, malleable, conductive, high melting point
- Conducts as a solid and liquid 
- properties differ because of valence electron count
- Middle metals have the highest melting points
- $Fe$; $Mg$

**Ionic compounds** - hard crystalline solids that melt at high temperatures; resistant to evaporation
- properties come from internal structure (alternating cations and anions)
- Conduct as liquids
- $NaCl$

**Covalent compounds** - lots of molecules held by relatively weak intermolecular forces
- Individual molecules are held by intramolecular covalent forces

**Network solids**
- Covalent bonds
- High melting points; difficult to break bonds; hard; poor conductors
- Diamond and Quartz ($SiO_{2}$)


#### Boiling points and vapour pressure
[Atmospheric Pressure and Boiling - Wayne Breslyn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiwynTBdln8)
- boiling point is higher the stronger intramolecular forces are
- bubbles are pockets of gaseous liquid - happens when there is enough spread between molecules
- When atmospheric pressure is equal to the vapour pressure of the liquid, the liquid will boil
- Boiling points INCREASE with pressure and therefore need more energy
	- pressure holds the molecules closer together, preventing bubbles from forming
- Lowest boiling point testing
	- High polarities mean higher boiling points
	- Bigger molecules mean higher boiling points (bigger = stronger INTERmolecular interactions)

[**Vapour pressure** - Wayne Breslyn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffBusZO-TO0)
Vapour pressure is like atmospheric pressure pushing against a liquid except in reverse.
It is the liquid's gaseous molecules pushing against the atmospheric pressure, reducing the pressure on the liquid
When the vapour pressure is increased, say by heating the liquid, the liquid now has more gas (vapour) pushing against the atmospheric pressure. This push allows bubbles to form

Boiling can happen when either the vapour pressure is increased or the atmospheric pressure is decreased

High vapour pressures = lower boiling point

Stronger inter/intramolecular attractions = lower vapour pressure = higher boiling point

Increase vapour pressure by heating a liquid (causing gas to assimilate into the atmosphere)
	Once equal to atmosphere pressure, the liquid will boil


1. `=-1.013*10^5 * (4.33-7.46)`
2. `=-2670.9 - ((25+273.15) * 1281.9) = -384869.385 kJ/mol`
