[[Electrostatic forces]]

In a polar bond, what does it mean when a side has the greater share of electron density? :: That side is more electronegative, represented by the Greek letter 'chi' ($\chi$ )

What condition must sigma ($\sigma$) bonds fulfil before overlapping? :: They must be half-filled (i.e. only have 1 of 2 electrons)
Sigma ($\sigma$) bond :: The strongest covalent bond type where an atom's orbital overlaps with another atom's orbital ![[W4 - Sigma bond.png]]
Pi ($\pi$) bond :: Generally weaker covalent bond type where an atom's orbital is perpendicular to another [Source - Byjus](https://byjus.com/chemistry/sigma-and-pi-bond/) ![[W4 - Pi bond.png]]
Diatomic bond :: A single/double/triple bond between two atoms (homonuclear (e.g. $O_2$) or heteronuclear (e.g. $NO$)) in a straight line 
Homonuclear :: Molecules singly comprised of one element (e.g. $O_{2}, F_{2}$)
Heteronuclear :: Molecules comprised of 2+ element types (e.g. $NaCl, H_{2O,}$)

Single bond :: 1 electron pair - single line
Double bond :: 2 electron pairs - double line
Triple bond :: 3 electron pairs - triple line

At what $\chi$ is a bond considered a non-polar covalent bond? :: 0.0 to roughly ~0.5$\chi$
At what $\chi$ is a bond considered to be a polar covalent bond? :: ~0.5 to ~2.0$\chi$
At what $\chi$ is a bond considered to be an ionic bond? :: 2.0 to 3.3$\chi$

What is general trend of electronegativity ($\chi$) on the periodic table? :: $\chi$ tends to increase from bottom-top and left-right across

What are the general characteristics of molecules with non-polar covalent bond? ::  They tend to be gas at room temperature. Examples: $CS_{2}$, $PH_{3}$, or $H_{2}$ 
What are the general characteristics of molecules with polar covalent bond? ::  They are a solid/liquid/gas at room temperature. Examples: $HF$ or $H_{2}O$
What are the general characteristics of molecules with an ionic bond? :: They tend to be solids at room temperature, are held together purely by attraction forces. Bonds are usually between a non-metal and metal, with the non-metal ripping electrons from the metal. Examples: $Na^{+}Cl^{-}$ or $NaF$

# Ionic compounds
Ionic compounds have a charge of $0\delta$ :: True. With this being true, we can also find the metal's charge from the anion's (non-metal) charge and count
Ionic compounds are molecules :: False. They are a lattice. Which apparently is not a molecule.
In Ionic compounds, metals tend to be anions :: False. They tend to be cations and non-metals anions
What will the charge of $Fe$ be in $FeCl_{2}$? :: 2+ ($Fe^{2+} Cl_{2}\text{}^{-2}$). Ferrous (II) Chloride.
What is an oxidation state? :: A differing ion charge, such as $Fe^{3+}$ having an oxidation state of 3

Binary Ionic compound :: Cation is fully written first then the anion's first syllable with '-ide' slapped on. Examples: $KI$=Potassium Iodide or $CaF_{2}$=Calcium Fluoride
Why do Binary Ionic compounds not always fully account for the true amount of atoms? :: Given the electric charges of the cation and anion, we can balance them out in a ratio. Take $CaF_{2}$ (Calcium Fluoride). Given that calcium has 2 spare electrons and fluorine needs 1, we need two fluorine atoms to balance the molecule (1:2 ratio).

What is a hydrate? :: A molecule with $H_{2}O$ 

# [Nomenclature](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/General_Chemistry/Nomenclature)
Polyatomic ions :: THEY HAVE NO NAVING CONVENTION (slide 16b)

Monoatomic :: A single atom considered to be stable - such as the noble/inert gases

When writing chemical formulas, which two elements have priority and why? :: Carbon is first, hydrogen second, and other elements in alphabetical order. This is because the majority of complex molecular compounds are carbon-containing compounds (e.g. $C_{4}H_{10}$, $C_4H_9BrO$)

Suffix: '-ite' :: Lesser of two oxyanions (and second of four ($ClO_{2}$=*Chlorite*)) containing <u>less</u> $O$ than the '-ate' oxyanion. e.g. $NO_{2}$=Nitrite, $NO_{3}$=Nitrate; $SO_{3}$=Sulphite, $SO_4$=Sulphate  
Suffix: '-ate' :: Greater of two oxyanions (and third of four ($ClO_{3}$=*Chlorate*)) containing <u>more</u> $O$ than the '-ite oxyanion. e.g. $NO_{2}$=Nitrite < $NO_{3}$=Nitrate; $SO_{3}$=Sulphite < $SO_4$=Sulphate
Prefix: 'hypo-' :: First of four oxyanions.  e.g. $ClO$=*Hypochlorate*
Prefix: 'per-' :: Fourth of four oxyanions. e.g. $ClO_{4}$=*Perchlorate* 

An acid in solution (aq) :: 'Hydro'\<anion name>'-ic acid'. e.g. Hydro\<chloric>ic acid
An acid not in solution :: Hydrogen \<anion name>'-ide'

$R-O-O-R'$ functional group name :: Peroxide
What does $R$ represent in a functional group? :: $R, R', R'',\text{ and } R'''$ denote one of the three: A hydrocarbon chain; A hydrogen; or any group of atoms [Source - LibreTexts ('Functional groups A')](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Organic_Chemistry/Supplemental_Modules_(Organic_Chemistry)/Fundamentals/Functional_groups_A)

# Misc.
Molecular formula :: Specifies the # of each atom in a molecule of a substance
Structural fomulae :: Honeycomb-like visuals. Used for quick writing of formulas. Each kink is always a Carbon connected to Hydrogens unless bonded to a different element/compound
How do you translate a structural formula to a chemical?
?
- Count all atoms of each type
- If no carbons:
	- Except $H$, elements further left on the periodic table appear first
	- $H$ is always written last except when with elements found in groups 16 or 17
	- If elements are from the same group, the heaviest element (i.e. lower down on the periodic table) appears first

Empirical formula :: The simplest ratio of each atom in a substance
Why are empirical formulas useful? :: By knowing the minimum components of a molecule, we can use a mass spectrometer to find the mass and know what percentages are what

Do molecular/empirical formulas tell you anything about chemical structure or atom attachments? :: No. Something like $C_{6}(H_{2}O)_6$ only tells you the atoms involved
