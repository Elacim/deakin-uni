Booklet on moodle has half the amount of slides -> true, but try scrolling down on each slide, there's the next one
Conservation of mass -> byproducts

-> Are all atoms elements?
-> Last class, in the chemical species chart, we saw that you can have molecules that are ions. Should this have included elements as ions? Or can you not have non-molecular, elemental ions?
-> How do we reference something like a class powerpoint? Should we?
-> Can you add like 2000 electrons to something like a hydrogen atom to make it weigh 2u?

Even though pressure decreases, the composition would remain the same
	- Air would mostly remain the same in different areas
What does this mean? How does the composition remain the same? Wouldn't there be less of certain parts in the atmosphere? I believe it's unfair to say air is uniform. Constant streams of misc. particles from random sources like animals breathing, pollution would surely alter this. Or is that so negligible that it is not worth considering? 


[[Week 1 - 133 Notes#http //isotopesmatter.com/lessons/intro.html Isotopes|Question location (slightly above)]] Neutrons keep the atom just close enough to keep the atom from falling apart  ***???***
So do atoms constantly want to rip apart and neutrons are the only thing really keeping them together?

What exactly is a reagant/reactant?
Do chemical equations always have to be `Reagant --React>> Product`?
