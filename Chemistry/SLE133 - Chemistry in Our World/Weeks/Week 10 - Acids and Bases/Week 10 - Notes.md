$PO_{4}^{3-}$
$Cl^{-}$

$HF$ is a stronger acid than $HBr$ :: False. It is a weak acid
Does $F^{-}$ have a conjugate base? :: No. As it is negatively charged, it would rather accept a proton than donate one, so it must be a base and therefore have a conjugate acid rather than conjugate base

$1.0 \times 10^{-14}=x \times 6.6 \times 10^{-4}$

$HNO_{3} + KOH \rightarrow H_{2}O + KNO_{2}$
$n(KOH)=0.155 \times 0.02135 = 0.00330925M$
Since it's a 1:1 ratio,
$C=\frac{0.00330925M}{0.025L}=0.13237$

In a titration of a 20mL sample of lactic acid ($CH_{3}CHOHCOOH$) with sodium hydroxide ($NaOH$), it was found that 17.25mL of 0.155M $NaOH$ was required to reach the equivalence point. How much lactic acid was in the sample in grams?

?
$HNO_{3} + KOH \rightarrow KNO_{3} + H_{2}O$

A 100mL sample of $2.0_{M}HNO_{3 (aq)}$ is added to 300 mL of $1.0_{M}KOH_{(aq)}$. What is the pH of this solution?
?
$HNO_{3} : n = 2.0_{M} \times 0.1L = 0.2mol$
$KOH: n=1.0_{M} \times 0.3: = 0.3mol$, there is an excess of $0.1mol$, so $OH^{-}$ would dictate the pH
Both nitric acid and potassium hydroxide, being strong, would completely dissociate.
$[OH^{-}]=\frac{ \text{mol OH- in excess} }{ L of solution } = \frac{0.1mol}{400mL} = 0.25_{M}$
$pOH = -log(0.25mol) = 0.60206$

$KOH:n=3.0_{M} \times 0.2L = 0.6mol$ (excess of 0.2mol)
$0.2mol/600mL=0.333_{M}OH$
$pOH=-log(0.333)=0.477$
$pH=14-0.477=13.523$
