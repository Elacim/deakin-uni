Limiting reagant - the reactant that is completely used up in a reaction, determining when the reaction halts. From the reaction stoichiometry - the exact amount of reactant neded to react with another elements can be calculated
- $2A + 3B \rightarrow C (2A+3B)$
Rarely have the exact amount of reagants to react completely
	the limiting reagant is the reactant that runs out first
	- excess reagant is the reagant that's left over


Alkanes ($C_2H_{4}$, $C_{5}H_{10}$ - hydrocarbons)
Alkanes :: Series of compounds containing carbon and hydrogen atoms with single covalent bonds
Alkyne :: Hydrocarbons containing carbon-carbon triple bonds

Ethylene + water -> ethanol + water
$3C_{2}H_{4}+ 5H_{2}O \rightarrow 3C_{2}H_{5}OH + 2H_{2}O$
$CH_{3}OH$ - methanol
$C_{2}H_{5}OH$ - ethanol ($OH$ group adds 'ol' to the end of a chemical) 

Slide 14b
Reaction of ethene with water to form ethanol. Starting with 10g of each reactant and 15g of ethanol
1. How many moles of each reactant?
	1. 0.357 moles of ethene, 0.555 mols of ethanol
2. What is the limiting reagant?
	1. Ethene
3. What is the theoretical yield of ethanol in moles?
	1. Theoretical yield is 0.357 mol (the ethene mole count)
4. What is the theoretical yield of ethanol in grams?
	1. Ethanol u = $2C \times 4H=24.022 + 4 + 16 + 1=45.022$
	2. $m=N \times M_{R} \rightarrow m=0.357M \times 45.022u=16.073g$
5. What percentage yield did they obtain?
	1. They got $15g$ out of $16.073g$
	2. $\frac{15}{16.073}=0.9332505602=93.3\%$
	3. 
$\%Yield = \frac{\text{actual yield (mol or grams)}}{\text{predicted yield (mol or grams)}}$
	- actual yield can never be more than the theoretical yield			
Liquid reagents - liquids are usually measured by volume rather than mass
	- to determine mol count, use density
		- density = mass (grams) / volume (in litres)
	- If a car used 14L of octane -> density of octane is 0.703g/mL
		- $d=\frac{m}{v}$ , solve for mass -> $d \times v = m$
		- $0.703\text{g/mL} \times (14.0 \times 10^{3}ml) = 9.842kg$
$\text{concentration}=\frac{\text{physical quantity in mole}}{{physical quantity in litres}} \rightarrow  c=\frac{n}{V}$

How to prepare a 100mL of an aqueous solution of 0.10M $CaBr_{2}$ (200g/mol)
?
1. number of moles req = $0.1 \text{ moles} \times 0.100 L=0.010$ moles
2. $0.010$ mol of $CaBr_{2}$. How much does this weigh? $200g/mol$
3. Weight out $200.0$ mol/g $\times 0.010M=2.0g$
4. Dissolve in 100mL of water

### Calculating theoretical yield

Slide 19a-20a
120ml of a potassium permanganate solution, prepped from 2.05g $KMnO_{4}$ in 250mL water, was reacted with 2.00mL pure isopropanol (density=0.785g/ml). A total of 0.805g of acetone was obtained
$2MnO_{4} + 6H^{+} + 5CH_{3}CHOHCH_{3} \rightarrow 2Mn^{2+} + 8H_{2}O + 5CH_{3}COCH_{3}$
1. How many moles of each reactant did you start with?
	1. Their respective coefficients and multiplied subscripts worth
	2. 0.0519M times 0.12L (120mL) = $0.00623$ manganese permanganate moles used 
	3. Moles used=concentration times the volume
2. Limiting reagent?
	1. Isopropanol
3. Theoretical yield of acetone in moles?
	1. 
4. Theoretical yield of acetone in grams?
	1. t
5. What percentage yield was obtained?
	1. t
