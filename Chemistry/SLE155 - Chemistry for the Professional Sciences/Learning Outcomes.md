### Week 3
describe how reactions can be reversible and write a chemical equation for a reversible reaction
describe the characteristics of a chemical equilibrium.define and calculate the equilibrium constant for a reaction
explain the meaning of the magnitude of an equilibrium constant and what it tells us about the equilibrium of a reaction
calculate the reaction quotient for a reaction and explain its relationship to the equilibrium constant
manipulate equilibrium constants for reversing a reaction, multiplying coefficients and adding reactions
calculate the equilibrium constant for a heterogenous mixture.

explain the relationship between Gibbs free energy and the equilibrium constant, and use ΔG to predict the outcome of a reaction
recognise and explain Le Châtelier’s principle
describe how equilibrium is affected by:
	adding or removing a product or reactant
	changing the pressure in gaseous reactions
	changing the temperature
	adding a catalyst.
