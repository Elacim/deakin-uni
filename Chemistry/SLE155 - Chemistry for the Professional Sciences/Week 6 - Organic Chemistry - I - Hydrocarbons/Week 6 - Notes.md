## Valence bond theory
**Orbital overlap model**
- Each e- is assigned to a specific orbital
- No two identical addresses (Pauli exclusiion)
- Electrons occupy lowest energy orbital (Aufbau)
- Only valence orbitals are needed to describe bonding

Electrons aren't being shared, it's the orbitals overlapping

What is a sigma bond? :: 

Three types of electrons:
Core electrons found in the inner shell
Valence electrons
	Paired
	Unpaired
A paired and unpaired 

What is the purpose of pairing? :: Stability

$sp^{3}$ orbital is $\frac{1}{4}s$ and $\frac{3}{4}p$
Methane ($CH_{4}$) has the hybrid orbital of... :: $sp_{3}$

```
CH4
2p: u- u- -
     sp3: u- u- u- u-
2s: ud
Carbon's p orbital is ud u u u, with the four hydrogens, it's ud ud ud ud u

```

$sp^{2}$ orbital for $BF_{3}$
Boron's electron configuration: $1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{1}$, it has 3 valence electrons. It has $\frac{1}{3}s$ and $\frac{2}{3}p$
S + 2p orbitals = $sp^{2}$

$sp$ orbital - $BeH_{2}$


**Multiple bond hybridisation:**
1. Determine lewis structure
2. Use lewis to dtermine hybridisation type
3. Construct the sigma framework
4. Add pi bonds

Single bond - one sigma only

Double bond - Ethene ($C_{2}H_{4}$)
Each carbon is $sp^{2}$ hybridised
One sigma and one pi bond
```
Goes from:
2s: ud
2p: u- u- -

to:
sp2: u- u- u-  P.z: u-

```

Triple bond - ethyne ($C_{2}H_{2}$)
Each carbon atom is $sp$ hybridised
One sigma and two pi

# Representations of molecules
Cyclo- meaning :: x amount of carbons that go in a circle (close off)

Carbon is a tetravalent element, meaning it forms 4 bonds with other atoms

$C_{2}H_{6}O$ = Dimethyl ether AND ethanol are isomers as they have the same chemical formula
$CH_{3}OCH_{3}$ = dimethyl ether
$CH_{3}CH_{2}OH$ = ethanol

1,2-dimethylcyclopentane can be one of two isomers. The only difference is a $CH_{3}$ group positioned upwards (trans) and the other downwards (cis)
What is cis-trans isomerism? :: A set of two isomers, one (cis) on the same side of a double bond and the other (trans) on the opposite sides of the double bond

# Functional groups
eth = 2

#### Alkanes
Alkanes: ane, double bond
	Non-polar w/ weak dispersion forces between molecules
	Alkanes w/ $1..4C$ atoms are gases
		$5..17C$: liquids
		$\geq 18$: waxy solids
	Density for $1..10C = 0.7g/mL$
	Isometric alkanes may have different physical properties
		Branched will have lower boiling points than straight chains
			More surface area (like in pentane vs 2,2-dimethylpentane) will have a higher boiling point

Aromatic group :: molecules that tend to smell (with a 6-carbon ring)
Alkyl :: 'Off that' 
Halide :: 'Halogen'
Alkyl halide :: 1 carbon with 4 bonds ??? Slide 15a

Alcohol :: Carbon connected to a $OH$ group
ether :: Oxygen between two R-groups (alkyl/aryl groups)
Amine :: A carbon attach to a $NH_{2}$ group
Amide :: $C=O-NH_{2}$
Am :: Nitrogen
Aldehyde :: $C-CO-H$

Methyl group :: $CH_{3}$
A characteristic feature of organic molecules that behaves predictably ::: What are functional groups?
What can functional groups be used to classify? :: Families of organic compounds

### Hydrocarbons
What is a hydrocarbon? :: A molecule made purely of carbons and hydrogens
What are the saturated hydrocarbons? :: Alkanes
What are the unsaturated hydrocarbons? :: Alkenes, Alkynes, and Arenes
Why are unsaturated hydrocarbons unsaturated? :: They have less than the maximum amount of hydrogen atoms (i.e. carbons with more than one bond)
More saturated = more difficulty connecting
Less saturated = more complex bonding with other molecules

Alkane carbon-carbon bonding characteristics :: The carbons only bond singly
Why are alkanes saturated? :: They have the minimal amount of carbon bonds, allowing the maximum (most saturated) of hydrogens

Pentane formula :: $C_{5}$
Constitutional isomer :: Isomers with large differences in structure and behaviour

What is the shape of cyclopropane? :: An enclosed triangle ($C_{3}H_6$)

Terms for describing carbon atom groups :: Primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary
If a carbon atom is described as tertiary, what does this mean? :: A carbon with 3 other carbons atoms bonded to it

### Nomenclature
International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) decides the names for chemicals

| Prefix | Carbon atoms |
| ------ | ------------ |
| meth-  | 1            |
| eth-   | 2            |
| prop-  | 3            |
| but-   | 4            |
| pent-  | 5            |
| hex-   | 6            |
| hept- | 7            |
| oct-   | 8            |
| non-   | 9            |
| dec-    | 10             |

Prefix show? :: The number of carbons in the parent chain
Infix show? :: The nature of the carbon bonding in the parent chain
Suffix show? :: The functional groups present in the compound


### Naming organic compounds
1. Find the longest carbon chain in the molecule and use the name of that chain as the parent name.
	1. tricksy bugger innit
2. Number the carbon atoms in the longest chain beginning at the end nearest the first branch point.
	1. This will enable the lowest combination of numbers to be used.
3. Identify and number the substituents according to their point of attachment to the main chain. 
	1. If there are two substituents on the same carbon, assign them both the same number.
4. Write the name as a single word, using hyphens to separate the different prefixes and using commas to separate numbers. 
	1. If two or more different substituents are present, name them in alphabetical order.

Functional group and a branch: Prefer numbering carbons closer to the functional group
If a functional group is found on a carbon atom that isn't 1, it should be stated in the name, like `5-methylhexan-3-ol`

If two or more identical substituents are
present, use the prefixes di-, tri-, tetra- to
indicate how many.

Ketone - always inner carbons
Alcohol - any carbons


Name for carbon-carbon single bond free rotation? :: Conformations
Number of conformations for a carbon-carbon single bond :: Infinite
What is a staggered conformation? :: The most stable rotation
What is an eclipsed conformation? :: The least stable (highest energy) rotation
