What is the most common medium for redox reactions? :: Aqueous solution
What is a half-reaction? :: One half of a redox reaction (either the oxidation or reduction part) 

What is an electrochemical cell? :: Redox reactions that either produce or require current
What is a galvanic/voltaic cell? :: An electrochemical cell that produces current
What is a electrolytic cell? :: An electrochemical cell that requires current

What is the standard potential? :: The amount of energy that could be produced or is required from a electrochemical cell
What would happen to the standard potential if you tried to reverse a redox reaction? :: It would reverse (i.e. + becomes - and - to +) which would prevent the reaction from occurring 

Up the number line - oxidation
Down the number line - reduction

**In a neutral pH medium (like water)**
$Al_{s} + Cu^{2+} \rightarrow Al^{3+} + Cu_{s}$
This is two half-equations
$Al_{s} \rightarrow Al^{3+}$ and $Cu^{2+} \rightarrow Cu_{s}$
Balance the charges:
$Al_{s} \rightarrow Al^{3+} + 3e^{-}$ (oxidation)
$Cu^{2+} + 2e^{-} \rightarrow Cu_{s}$ (reduction)
Multiply to find:
The $3e^{-}$ are multiplied by $2e^{-}$ to get $6e^{-}$ total
$2Al_{s} + 3Cu^{2+} \rightarrow 3Al^{3+} + 2Cu_{s}$

**Galvanic cells - SLIDES 14b-19b**
Comprised of two half cells, the oxidiser and reducer, that have a potential difference in Volts ($V$)
Volts are joules/coulombs - $V=\frac{\text{joules (J)}}{\text{coulombs (C)}}$
? :: Ability is determined by reaction partner
$CuSO_{4} + Zn_{s} \rightarrow Cu_{s} + ZnSO_{4}$

Oxidation states of solids are zero

Galvanic cell reactions depend on the metal partners. $Cu_{s}$ won't react with $ZnSO_{4}^{2-}$ but it will react with a silver solution

A copper coil dipped into colourless solution with silver ions. Copper dissolves -> blue solution; metallic silver deposits as crystals on the surface of the copper wire

$Cu_{s} \rightarrow Cu^{2+} + 2e^{-}$
$2Ag+ 2e^{-} \rightarrow 2Ag_{s}$
$Cu_{s} + 2Ag^{+} \rightarrow Cu^{2+} + 2Ag_{s}$

A ............ is used to find the potential difference of a galvanic cell :: Potentiometer
Salt bridge :: Balances the number of anions in a given solution by providing them from itself (e.g. a potassium nitrate bridge); accounts for spectator ions in a reaction
Name for the reaction in a galvanic cell :: Cell reaction
Another name for **potential difference** ::: What is: another name for **electromotive force (emf)**

As the electrons flow from left to right, the zinc rod loses it's electrons to the copper rod, the copper sulphate binds to the copper rod, forming
The salt bridge is made of a substance to replenish the side losing the anions (e.g. if Zn is losing sulphates, the salt bridge should be made of a material like potassium sulphate; if Cu is losing nitrates, the salt bridge should be made of a material like sodium nitrate)

Requirements for a galvanic cell to work :: Both half-cell solutions must be electrically neutral
What does the salt bridge do? :: Permits ion movement to keep the solutions electrically neutral
What is a salt bridge filled with? :: A tube with a salt solution with ions not used in the cell reaction

Equation for the maximum potential of a given cell :: $E_{\text{cell potential}} = E_{cathode} - E_{anode}$
