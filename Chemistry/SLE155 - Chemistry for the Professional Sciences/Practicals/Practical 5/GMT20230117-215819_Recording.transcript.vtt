00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.940
Rob Mcneill: Good morning.

2
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.400
Rob Mcneill: Morning. How you doing

3
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.900
DEEPA RAM: good? Oh, good!

4
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.629
Rob Mcneill: I've got my my cameras off because I use my laptop to ride on.

5
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.930
DEEPA RAM: Yup! Is everyone here, and wait for another 2 to 3 min, and then we start.

6
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:52.489
DEEPA RAM: and if you're not ready with your what you call your

7
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.290
DEEPA RAM: the worksheets just download from the moodle.

8
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:04.980
DEEPA RAM: I think it's written track, for on the top strike it over the right track. 5. Okay, because last climate it was practical.

9
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.679
DEEPA RAM: so forgot to change it. This promise to

10
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.860
DEEPA RAM: Yes, yes, yes.

11
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.679
DEEPA RAM: so it's just building some models. Now, since you guys are sitting online.

12
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.479
DEEPA RAM: if you want to build it on your own, then you have to use that more view.

13
00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.169
DEEPA RAM: So I can just give you update you.

14
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.579
DEEPA RAM: I can update you the details of this more view

15
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:13.700
DEEPA RAM: if if you want to do it, but otherwise I will be making the models for you and I'll be showing it on the camera.

16
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.230
DEEPA RAM: I can. You can have a look at that, and then draw

17
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.559
DEEPA RAM: the structure. So it's more about drawing the structures identifying the different

18
00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.970
DEEPA RAM: and things like that. So

19
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.290
DEEPA RAM: some of you may not need my help at all, because the questions are all day on the worksheet.

20
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.020
DEEPA RAM: Most of you will be able to answer those questions without seeing the structures also.

21
00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.470
DEEPA RAM: But for those of you who are not.

22
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:53.299
DEEPA RAM: you know. Okay, with the okay part, then I can. I'll show you the structures, too. Okay, so it's all about. You know, you working on your own basically

23
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.340
DEEPA RAM: But I've got

24
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.020
molecular model set here, which

25
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.490
DEEPA RAM: I hope you can see. Oh.

26
00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.519
I've changed my

27
00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.540
DEEPA RAM: video virtual background

28
00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:08.340
to

29
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.750
DEEPA RAM: and blow my background. Yes, so I hope you can see it now.

30
00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.170
DEEPA RAM: Yeah. So this is the key that I would be using

31
00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.819
DEEPA RAM: It's got all those recall

32
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.320
DEEPA RAM: the ball sticks, and both in there

33
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:21.749
DEEPA RAM: she can see

34
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:29.540
DEEPA RAM: right. So this is what i'll be using. I'll be making the models with these balls and sticks, and then i'll be showing it to you

35
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.509
DEEPA RAM: with which you will be able to answer your question.

36
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:47.869
nina handler: Sorry to interrupt, but I can't say the option to submit. This is just the later. I can't say the option to submit the practical.

37
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:54.779
DEEPA RAM: I did it now, so it should be able to see. Now, thank you.

38
00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.310
DEEPA RAM: Now for those who are not in this class.

39
00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:14.600
DEEPA RAM: There are 2 of you who don't one. Yeah, one for us. Don't belong to this class. But yeah, so you can finish it and send it to me by email or something. That will be better. Okay, rather than adding, You let me see if I can add you in there, and then you can submit

40
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:19.599
DEEPA RAM: otherwise. Just finish it off and send it to me before 1230. Okay.

41
00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:30.150
DEEPA RAM: And for others you should be able to see. Now.

42
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:35.539
DEEPA RAM: can you just refresh and have a look at that? I thought I had made it visible

43
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.409
DEEPA RAM: with the right date.

44
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.410
DEEPA RAM: Can someone have a look and let me know?

45
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:44.200
DEEPA RAM: You still can't see it.

46
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.010
DEEPA RAM: Okay, Give me a minute.

47
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:09.090
DEEPA RAM: Yes, yes, yes.

48
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.170
DEEPA RAM: I've changed the page and everything, but I didn't make it visible.

49
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:15.500
DEEPA RAM: My bet

50
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.090
DEEPA RAM: done now

51
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.320
DEEPA RAM: Now

52
00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:14.439
DEEPA RAM: what I've put in the chat now is

53
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:20.480
DEEPA RAM: like Link, where you can go and build your own models if you wish to.

54
00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:33.310
DEEPA RAM: Yes, so that way you can work at your own case, and I mean. Once you build a model, it's a bit of a it's a bit of a working both. So once you build a model, you will get an idea of how that looks like in 3 dimension.

55
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:52.600
DEEPA RAM: Okay. So what I've been doing is I'll be going on to the worksheet first, and then we'll look at the question.

56
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.610
DEEPA RAM: I'll build a model and show it to you. Okay.

57
00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:02.249
DEEPA RAM: most of the questions, even without seeing the more you should be able to answer, because you know the theory part of it.

58
00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:08.010
Hmm.

59
00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:26.839
DEEPA RAM: So this is how that mobile software looks like. So you can actually

60
00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:37.139
DEEPA RAM: put in any element from here into that structure you can build your own structure. You can put the bones. You can put the elements there and then you see that in 3 dimension in here.

61
00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.089
DEEPA RAM: Okay, so that's a more you.

62
00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:48.150
DEEPA RAM: I've already updated that in the model. So if you want, you can just give it. Try. With this link which I put up here.

63
00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:52.799
DEEPA RAM: Okay, Anyway, I'm going on to the worksheets.

64
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.490
DEEPA RAM: Are you able to see the worksheets?

65
00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.400
DEEPA RAM: So this is what they have.

66
00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.749
DEEPA RAM: The discussion question is something which you can work on your own.

67
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:00.750
DEEPA RAM: Okay.

68
00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:07.619
DEEPA RAM: so are the following objects: Some molecules, chiral or not. So what I mean by Kyle.

69
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.929
DEEPA RAM: 2 objects you've. You've got the complete

70
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:16.509
DEEPA RAM: lecture for this. So you know what Chiral and a card on me right?

71
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:23.090
DEEPA RAM: So Kyle is when there are 2 objects which are not superimposable.

72
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.260
DEEPA RAM: and which

73
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:28.180
DEEPA RAM: do not have a plane of symmetry. So that's how you know something is Kyle

74
00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:31.069
DEEPA RAM: right? That do not have a plan of symmetry.

75
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:34.349
DEEPA RAM: It is something which has the plane of symmetry

76
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:38.290
DEEPA RAM: all right, so it looks symmetric.

77
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:40.419
DEEPA RAM: It has a plan of symmetry.

78
00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:45.140
DEEPA RAM: and therefore it's not title. So not Kiral, is what we call as a.

79
00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:57.860
DEEPA RAM: So you can just quickly work out those 3 questions in question number one.

80
00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:01.779
DEEPA RAM: Once you finish that it'll move on to question 2

81
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:15.419
DEEPA RAM: done with question number one.

82
00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.310
DEEPA RAM: Now we move on to question number 2:

83
00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.350
DEEPA RAM: What's the difference between a studio center and a Kyoto molecule.

84
00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:30.719
DEEPA RAM: So these are things like, you know. You can work out on your own.

85
00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:36.240
DEEPA RAM: I can't give you the answer for these.

86
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:41.650
DEEPA RAM: You've already had the lecture for this. And you know what the difference between studio and

87
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:47.260
DEEPA RAM: so data center is basically a carbon center where there are 4 different connections onto it. All 4 different atoms. A group of items connected

88
00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:51.909
DEEPA RAM: and chirality is, or a molecule.

89
00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:56.839
DEEPA RAM: it could be mainly due to the presence of a studio center.

90
00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:03.469
DEEPA RAM: So there is a studio center, like if there are 4 different groups connected to the carbon center, then

91
00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:06.409
DEEPA RAM: normally, it will not have a plane of symmetry.

92
00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:07.350
DEEPA RAM: right?

93
00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.089
DEEPA RAM: All good move to the next one.

94
00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:04.029
DEEPA RAM: I know most of you might have already answered these questions.

95
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.430
DEEPA RAM: What's the relationship between a kernel molecule and in

96
00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:20.780
DEEPA RAM: so Kyle molecule is again a single molecule which does not have any molecule which does not have a plane of symmetry, or which has a studio center. Therefore it does not have a plan of symmetry.

97
00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:23.470
DEEPA RAM: I guess that's for a molecule

98
00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.350
DEEPA RAM: Enantiomerism is for

99
00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:31.630
DEEPA RAM: 2 molecules together. Okay. So it's a pair of Cairo substances.

100
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:36.499
DEEPA RAM: So it's a pair of chiral molecules which has

101
00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.129
DEEPA RAM: middle of a major relationship between them.

102
00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:45.229
DEEPA RAM: So a molecule, which is Cairo with its mirror image, which is Also, Cairo

103
00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:47.469
DEEPA RAM: makes a pair of enzymes.

104
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:41.080
Okay.

105
00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.459
DEEPA RAM: move to the next.

106
00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.710
DEEPA RAM: So for this one

107
00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:56.049
DEEPA RAM: and the right hand box or a picture of the model you have constructed. So how it can appear to have one angle of 90.

108
00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:09.070
DEEPA RAM: Okay, and you know, it says, do not draw a edge and dash with structure. Okay. So they just asking you to put lines for the bonds Just normalize would be fine.

109
00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:13.870
DEEPA RAM: Now, as it appears to have 90 degree, we know that. So

110
00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:18.630
DEEPA RAM: this is what it is. Okay, as you can see, this is what it is

111
00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:19.600
DEEPA RAM: right.

112
00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:20.690
It's

113
00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:21.850
just

114
00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:23.770
DEEPA RAM: meeting right?

115
00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:30.450
DEEPA RAM: Right? So you know that the angle for meeting is

116
00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.829
DEEPA RAM: tetrahedral. What's the angle of a title?

117
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:49.740
DEEPA RAM: One or 9.5 isn't it. That's the angle for to try it. You'll see and all that maintain a stretch or he'll. But it's just asking you of your question, like you know. How would it appear if it was drawn in 90 degrees? So you can just put it as a 90 degree

118
00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:52.730
DEEPA RAM: at right angles. How that would be like

119
00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.580
DEEPA RAM: It's just a weird question, just to

120
00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:58.999
DEEPA RAM: no to just to

121
00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:02.979
DEEPA RAM: yeah to work out your imagination how it would be like

122
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:05.590
DEEPA RAM: your visualization. Okay.

123
00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:26.729
DEEPA RAM: and 5 and 6 Also, I can answer it for you to answer. I've only given the answer just now. But yeah, work it out.

124
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:37.140
DEEPA RAM: Done

125
00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:38.559
DEEPA RAM: what you next.

126
00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:46.519
DEEPA RAM: So you know the name of the geometry right? The name of the jump is, what do you provide?

127
00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:53.330
DEEPA RAM: Yeah, whether it is linear or trigonal, or to try it or whatever it is. Okay.

128
00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.130
yeah.

129
00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:03.680
DEEPA RAM: the next one is to build a model of chloro methane.

130
00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:09.940
DEEPA RAM: Retail. Chloride is a common name. Chloro meeting is a.

131
00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.889
DEEPA RAM: So here you have to draw

132
00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.340
DEEPA RAM: a which and dashboard structure

133
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:29.129
DEEPA RAM: that best illustrate the geometry about the central item in the other box draw another picture of the model from a different angle. So one is only given for you. So this is how the wedge and dash, which looks like

134
00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:31.499
DEEPA RAM: So, which is a particular one.

135
00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:33.470
DEEPA RAM: and the dashboard is the

136
00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:39.739
DEEPA RAM: the one to the one behind. Okay. So this chlorine is seeking out the

137
00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.199
DEEPA RAM: out of the plane and

138
00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:58.120
DEEPA RAM: the hydrogen that that hydrogen is actually behind the the the plan. Okay. So when we are representing a 3 dimensional molecule on a 2 dimensional plane, we need to put them as we just in dash, which is just to make

139
00:23:58.530 --> 00:23:59.970
others

140
00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:06.919
DEEPA RAM: understand those are viewing it. Understand that Well, this atom is not on the plane, but sticking out or below.

141
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:08.830
DEEPA RAM: I mean so behind the plane.

142
00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:13.280
DEEPA RAM: so you can draw the same

143
00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:15.470
DEEPA RAM: one here this

144
00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:20.069
DEEPA RAM: and now the 2, now the 2 atoms as

145
00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:20.950
DEEPA RAM: like.

146
00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:24.780
DEEPA RAM: Oh, you know, if you turn it around, how would you draw it?

147
00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:29.859
DEEPA RAM: So maybe this hydrogen will come to the front. Just go to the back. Okay.

148
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:32.489
DEEPA RAM: So put in a different way. Here

149
00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:56.220
DEEPA RAM: are you able to see me on camera, or do you want me to

150
00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.269
DEEPA RAM: stop, share and

151
00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.220
DEEPA RAM: show you on camera on?

152
00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:04.850
Rob Mcneill: No, we can see.

153
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:10.370
DEEPA RAM: So one of the hydrogen's, every place with a green color, which is a chlorine. Okay.

154
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:17.600
DEEPA RAM: So still the geometry remains the same. Everything remains the same except that

155
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:20.390
DEEPA RAM: one hydrogen is replaced by glory.

156
00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:57.359
DEEPA RAM: You can answer question 8 also

157
00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:13.490
DEEPA RAM: done.

158
00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:14.890
Yeah.

159
00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.340
DEEPA RAM: Question. 9.

160
00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:24.410
DEEPA RAM: In the Ch. 3 seal are the 3 hydrogen items equivalent. So what do you think of these 3 hydrogen items connected to the car.

161
00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.800
DEEPA RAM: So what do you mean by equivalent?

162
00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:34.950
DEEPA RAM: So to which means that, do they have identical environment with respect to the other items adjacent to themselves.

163
00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:43.420
DEEPA RAM: So it's all to do with the connectivity. Okay. So we know that all the 3 hydrogen's are connected to the same carbon.

164
00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:45.999
DEEPA RAM: We just connect you to the chlorine

165
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:47.240
DEEPA RAM: right?

166
00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:50.620
DEEPA RAM: So which means that all the 3 hydrogen's are in

167
00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:53.060
DEEPA RAM: an equal, and beyond it doesn't it

168
00:28:55.930 --> 00:29:03.940
DEEPA RAM: because they are all connected to the same carbon, so they are all equally distant from the chlorine, and affected by chlorine in the same way.

169
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.990
DEEPA RAM: Right?

170
00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:07.670
DEEPA RAM: So that's what it will mean.

171
00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:06.809
DEEPA RAM: Oh, good move to next one.

172
00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:29.649
DEEPA RAM: Now the 2 boxes below draw the vet and dash which pictures of See See h, 2 be our Cl. From different angular viewpoints. Okay, just make the model for you.

173
00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:33.739
DEEPA RAM: So one more hydrogen is replaced by a Brahmin.

174
00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:44.910
DEEPA RAM: That's what it is. It's the same digital structure as you can see. Right

175
00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:47.800
DEEPA RAM: a hydrogen. So there are 2 hydrogen's. Now

176
00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:50.520
DEEPA RAM: these 2 are the hydrogen's right.

177
00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:55.160
DEEPA RAM: and then we have a chlorine and to have a prominent.

178
00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:56.779
DEEPA RAM: It's the same structure.

179
00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:00.540
DEEPA RAM: the same geometry, right?

180
00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:06.740
DEEPA RAM: But maybe you can keep it like this control. So when you keep it like this

181
00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:07.730
DEEPA RAM: right?

182
00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:15.150
DEEPA RAM: You find that. So if you keep it this way, you find that this atom.

183
00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:19.880
DEEPA RAM: the Brahmin and the hydrogen are on the same plane of carbon.

184
00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:26.170
DEEPA RAM: But this hydrogen is to the front, and this is behind. Okay.

185
00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:31.089
DEEPA RAM: So there's one way of putting it. Then roll it over and draw another way. So now

186
00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.829
DEEPA RAM: the Brahmin

187
00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:41.810
DEEPA RAM: Sorry. Now, though. Yeah. Now the chlorine and the hydrogen are on the same plane as that of that that of carbon.

188
00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:48.769
DEEPA RAM: Okay. So for the when it's on the same plane you draw the single lines for these 2 bonds. Okay, with the chlorine and with the hydrogen

189
00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:49.750
DEEPA RAM: and

190
00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:53.770
DEEPA RAM: one hydrogen is the front. So you put a thick which for that

191
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:58.730
DEEPA RAM: and one the the bromine is behind. So therefore you put a dash which for that.

192
00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:04.559
DEEPA RAM: Okay, so draw 2 different

193
00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:06.400
new points

194
00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:21.020
DEEPA RAM: and also answer question 11, so that you can answer on your own.

195
00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:44.689
DEEPA RAM: Yeah, a question 12 Also, you can answer on your own.

196
00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:48.899
DEEPA RAM: Now we don't want, and now we know what equivalent

197
00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:51.810
DEEPA RAM: atoms

198
00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:41.270
DEEPA RAM: done.

199
00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:42.789
DEEPA RAM: Move to next one.

200
00:36:47.410 --> 00:36:52.459
DEEPA RAM: C 2 hit 6. So by the time you finish answering that i'll make it to hit 6.

201
00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:19.040
DEEPA RAM: Yup. So that is C 2 hit 6

202
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:20.509
DEEPA RAM: right.

203
00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:24.390
DEEPA RAM: You can put it in any way you like.

204
00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:26.880
DEEPA RAM: You would like this.

205
00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:28.680
DEEPA RAM: The 2 carbons

206
00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:35.290
DEEPA RAM: all right. So the 2 carbons wanted to each other, and the right 3 hydrogens with each carbon.

207
00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:44.849
DEEPA RAM: Now, special thing about the single one is that you can actually rotate it. Make any possible structure

208
00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:51.390
DEEPA RAM: all right, but they are all 81 structures, because you can rotate it, and bring it back to the same thing.

209
00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:56.659
DEEPA RAM: Right? So free rotation is possible about the carbon-carbon, single bond.

210
00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:06.140
DEEPA RAM: So when you're putting it as a veg or d with structure.

211
00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:08.949
DEEPA RAM: The 2 carbons right.

212
00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.089
DEEPA RAM: the 2 hydrogen's on the top.

213
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:16.430
DEEPA RAM: They are on the same plan. Those 4 items are on the same line.

214
00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:19.239
DEEPA RAM: The hydrogen Here is the franchise.

215
00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:22.149
DEEPA RAM: The hydrogen here is also to the front.

216
00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:25.010
DEEPA RAM: and there are 2 high regions behind.

217
00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:28.720
Okay.

218
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:39.740
DEEPA RAM: Lewis structure is how you see this. Okay?

219
00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:44.580
DEEPA RAM: So you write the carbon, the single bond between them and the hydrogen, and all that

220
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:51.690
DEEPA RAM: content structure is putting this together one end together with the carbon, so C, H. 3,

221
00:38:51.960 --> 00:39:00.229
DEEPA RAM: and then this together as one. See H. 3, right? So you just you don't like, draw any lines in between you. Just write C. H, 3, C. H. 3.

222
00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:01.540
DEEPA RAM: That's it. Okay?

223
00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:42.690
DEEPA RAM: And then it can answer the remaining questions, too.

224
00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:36.509
DEEPA RAM: should be able to answer 14 and 15

225
00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:57.100
DEEPA RAM: done

226
00:44:57.730 --> 00:44:58.780
DEEPA RAM: move to next.

227
00:45:01.210 --> 00:45:03.069
DEEPA RAM: Also write the Epc name.

228
00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:14.630
DEEPA RAM: and moving on to the next page. So we need to replace one of the hydrogen. So it's a chlorine. Okay.

229
00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:16.770
DEEPA RAM: i'm going to do that

230
00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:26.169
check.

231
00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:27.610
DEEPA RAM: So that's it

232
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:29.200
DEEPA RAM: right?

233
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:42.290
DEEPA RAM: So I've taken away one hydrogen and put a clone in place. That's the only thing. So one carbon has got 3 hydrogen's. The second carbon is got 2 hydrogen's and a chloride.

234
00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:46.059
So this is what it looks like.

235
00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:53.799
Okay.

236
00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:11.540
DEEPA RAM: Now, the question is all the 2 carbons equivalent.

237
00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:18.819
DEEPA RAM: So one carbon is got 3 hydrogen's, the other carbon has got 2 hydrogens and a chlorine.

238
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:22.610
DEEPA RAM: Yeah. So you can answer. Accordingly.

239
00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:41.449
DEEPA RAM: you're not asked to draw the model. You just asked to build the model. So I've built it for you. Okay, just have to answer these questions

240
00:46:42.250 --> 00:46:46.089
DEEPA RAM: and on the 5 hydrogen items that you will in think about it.

241
00:46:54.360 --> 00:47:01.630
DEEPA RAM: so that are 5 hydrogen in total, isn't it. So these 3 are connected to the same carbon. These 2 are connected to the same carbon.

242
00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:03.740
DEEPA RAM: But

243
00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:08.289
DEEPA RAM: if the carbons are not equivalent, then think about it how it's going to be.

244
00:47:16.330 --> 00:47:18.500
DEEPA RAM: and also right the I apc name

245
00:50:40.830 --> 00:50:41.620
DEEPA RAM: done

246
00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:47.910
DEEPA RAM: right that you.

247
00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:55.399
DEEPA RAM: if you rotate the hydrogen atoms to a different position by turning about the central carbon-carbon bond

248
00:50:55.510 --> 00:51:00.609
DEEPA RAM: to get different structural Isomer. So i'm going to turn it around for you.

249
00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:03.150
DEEPA RAM: Okay. So i'm going to turn it around.

250
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:08.769
DEEPA RAM: They can actually come back to the same structure. Alright, there's no change in the structure at all.

251
00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:13.030
DEEPA RAM: Yeah, See that can come back to a strange, same structure. It's in it.

252
00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:20.009
DEEPA RAM: But do you get a different structure. What do you mean by structuralize them? Or a constitutional Isomer?

253
00:51:22.210 --> 00:51:25.390
DEEPA RAM: Optional is summer or constitutional license.

254
00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:27.930
DEEPA RAM: You have a different connectivity.

255
00:51:28.450 --> 00:51:32.099
DEEPA RAM: If the connections are still the same. Then it is the same thing.

256
00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:39.370
DEEPA RAM: It's not a different Isomer. Okay, yeah.

257
00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:38.669
DEEPA RAM: okay, we'll watch the next one

258
00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:44.409
DEEPA RAM: built all possible models for.

259
00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:52.190
DEEPA RAM: So now we've got 2 chlorines. Okay, Which means that I have to replace one more hydrogen with another chlorine.

260
00:52:53.290 --> 00:52:54.160
DEEPA RAM: Okay?

261
00:52:54.180 --> 00:53:00.720
DEEPA RAM: And what are the different ways They can do it. So there are 2 carbons. There should be 4 hydrogens and 2 chlorines.

262
00:53:01.310 --> 00:53:02.220
DEEPA RAM: So

263
00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:04.529
DEEPA RAM: what it can do is, I can

264
00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:07.830
DEEPA RAM: have

265
00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:09.790
DEEPA RAM: a chlorine

266
00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:14.380
DEEPA RAM: been a new chlorine input on the same carbon

267
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:18.400
DEEPA RAM: as we have the old one. Okay, which is this carbon

268
00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:21.980
DEEPA RAM: or I can put a chlorine on the

269
00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:25.409
DEEPA RAM: other carbon. Okay, so i'll show you

270
00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:29.130
DEEPA RAM: one of that first here.

271
00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:42.610
DEEPA RAM: So that is one, right?

272
00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:56.259
DEEPA RAM: So if put the the the the first hydrogen is got all the 3 height. So our first carbon is what all the 3 hydrogen's in it. And this carbon has got 2 chlorines and heights. Okay, so that's one way of putting it right.

273
00:53:56.770 --> 00:53:58.370
DEEPA RAM: Not the way is

274
00:53:58.410 --> 00:53:59.319
DEEPA RAM: to go

275
00:53:59.590 --> 00:54:01.590
DEEPA RAM: one of the clone from here

276
00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:05.100
DEEPA RAM: and

277
00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:09.130
DEEPA RAM: put it on the all the cop

278
00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:11.279
DEEPA RAM: right?

279
00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:14.579
DEEPA RAM: So that is 2 different connectivity, as you can see

280
00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:18.830
DEEPA RAM: fine.

281
00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:23.250
DEEPA RAM: so you can draw the content structure

282
00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:28.029
DEEPA RAM: of the 2 Isomers

283
00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:33.939
DEEPA RAM: and also the ups and names.

284
00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:41.899
Okay.

285
00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:48.059
DEEPA RAM: So both chlorines on the same carbon, and

286
00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:50.260
DEEPA RAM: each cl run on different car.

287
00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:26.870
DEEPA RAM: The next one, C, 4, H. 10,

288
00:59:26.890 --> 00:59:31.620
DEEPA RAM: Okay, 4 carbons in a row. Each carbon is tetrahedral.

289
00:59:31.750 --> 00:59:33.850
DEEPA RAM: It's got 4 connections.

290
00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:36.679
DEEPA RAM: so the carbon, the first carbon.

291
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:38.849
DEEPA RAM: It's got 3 hydrogen's.

292
00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:41.660
DEEPA RAM: and the fourth board is connected to the second carbon.

293
00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:45.039
DEEPA RAM: and that carbon is got 2 hydrogen's, and

294
00:59:45.610 --> 00:59:49.630
DEEPA RAM: the bond is connected to the next carbon, and this carbon has got

295
00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:51.229
DEEPA RAM: 2 hydrogen's

296
00:59:51.540 --> 00:59:57.209
DEEPA RAM: connected to the next car and the last car, and again, it's got 3 hydrogen's. Okay, simple structure.

297
01:00:01.530 --> 01:00:05.709
DEEPA RAM: You can find that all the carbons are having a tetrahedral

298
01:00:05.790 --> 01:00:08.280
DEEPA RAM: with the one on 9.5 degree angle.

299
01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:11.649
DEEPA RAM: because it's all single born between the conference.

300
01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:19.300
DEEPA RAM: Okay, so this is one way of doing, say for H 10,

301
01:00:19.610 --> 01:00:21.040
DEEPA RAM: What can be another way?

302
01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:26.149
DEEPA RAM: You can have 3 carbons in a row. Okay.

303
01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:34.089
DEEPA RAM: and then take away that last carbon. Okay, I'm going to take away the last carbon with its hydrogen. Okay?

304
01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:38.109
DEEPA RAM: And then i'm going to take away a hydrogen from the middle carbon here.

305
01:00:38.610 --> 01:00:44.489
DEEPA RAM: and i'm going to put that carbon in here so that creates a branch as you can see.

306
01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:45.879
DEEPA RAM: All right.

307
01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:51.250
DEEPA RAM: So 3 carbons in a row, and then this middle carbon has got a branch

308
01:00:51.370 --> 01:00:52.629
DEEPA RAM: with the C. H. 3.

309
01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:58.160
DEEPA RAM: How would you name this

310
01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:01.419
DEEPA RAM: so it's a 3 carbon with a branch.

311
01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:10.369
DEEPA RAM: C. H. 3 meet highly connected to the second carbon, so you can name it. Also, you can draw the schedule structure. It's just this. Okay, the skeletal structure is this.

312
01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:12.569
DEEPA RAM: But with the carbon and hydrogen

313
01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:19.640
DEEPA RAM: and code instructive will be the Ch. 3. Then the Ch. With the Ch. 3, and then a. C. H. 3. All right. So

314
01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:20.720
DEEPA RAM: do it.

315
01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:24.240
DEEPA RAM: The appropriate answer, the questions, the appropriate way.

316
01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:28.899
DEEPA RAM: So I've shown you both. Okay.

317
01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:34.590
DEEPA RAM: Is another structure possible? No, that's the maximum branching possible for

318
01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:35.540
DEEPA RAM: see? Full

319
01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:50.700
DEEPA RAM: done.

320
01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:54.279
DEEPA RAM: A:

321
01:06:05.090 --> 01:06:06.620
DEEPA RAM: So just to

322
01:06:09.370 --> 01:06:10.419
DEEPA RAM: now

323
01:06:11.290 --> 01:06:14.169
DEEPA RAM: we've been asked to construct a model of meeting

324
01:06:15.010 --> 01:06:19.249
DEEPA RAM: and also more of a. So I've done 2 meetings. Basically, okay.

325
01:06:19.850 --> 01:06:20.560
DEEPA RAM: right?

326
01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:30.310
DEEPA RAM: So can the member may just be superimposed on the original or anything.

327
01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:32.519
DEEPA RAM: So if you put on that.

328
01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:36.109
DEEPA RAM: the parts match so superimposition means

329
01:06:36.170 --> 01:06:38.040
DEEPA RAM: whether the parts match

330
01:06:38.130 --> 01:06:47.890
DEEPA RAM: when you put it in one form so like this is how they will see to remove you. So you mentioned that there is a mirror here. So this is exactly how they will see this number.

331
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:54.729
DEEPA RAM: and just like that if I take one put on top of the other the parts. Match. Okay, Sorry.

332
01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:58.419
DEEPA RAM: The pots match right?

333
01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:08.750
DEEPA RAM: Oh, good

334
01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:15.740
DEEPA RAM: question. Number 26 Does meeting contain a plan of symmetry. What do you think is the test of plan of symmetry?

335
01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:18.720
DEEPA RAM: Can it be cut across

336
01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:21.850
DEEPA RAM: the Adams? So the one of the to

337
01:07:21.890 --> 01:07:26.289
DEEPA RAM: the one behind and the carbon in the middle. If you cut it off, you get to exact house.

338
01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:30.370
DEEPA RAM: Basically it's got 4 planes of symmetry.

339
01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:40.569
DEEPA RAM: And is it, Cairo? Answer your question.

340
01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:47.409
DEEPA RAM: So by the time you and so those 2 questions i'll make the next one for you. Okay.

341
01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:17.580
DEEPA RAM: So these questions you don't have to explain. Okay, you just have to say.

342
01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:19.409
DEEPA RAM: but they Yes, I know.

343
01:08:19.710 --> 01:08:20.490
DEEPA RAM: Well.

344
01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:23.969
DEEPA RAM: but it's okay. Just yes, so no questions.

345
01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:26.990
DEEPA RAM: Now, that is chloro meeting

346
01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:30.080
DEEPA RAM: so same story.

347
01:08:32.750 --> 01:08:34.080
DEEPA RAM: the portsmatch.

348
01:08:34.399 --> 01:08:36.979
DEEPA RAM: because there is 2 kind of symmetry.

349
01:08:37.290 --> 01:08:39.710
DEEPA RAM: the spac, and cut it despite and cut it.

350
01:08:40.670 --> 01:08:44.030
DEEPA RAM: and feel supreme on the on the original

351
01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:45.500
DEEPA RAM: it's it's like

352
01:08:56.210 --> 01:08:58.959
So answer question 2829, and 30

353
01:09:05.330 --> 01:09:07.989
DEEPA RAM: by then I would make the next one.

354
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:47.040
DEEPA RAM: So look at this now

355
01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:05.120
DEEPA RAM: still has a plan of symmetry. Okay, so cottage it crawls the orange, the green and the common of the black

356
01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:10.840
DEEPA RAM: through through the center. Okay, those 2 bones and the carbon

357
01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:12.590
DEEPA RAM: still has a plan of symmetry.

358
01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:15.989
DEEPA RAM: a good 2 hydrogen on either side for both of them.

359
01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:23.750
DEEPA RAM: Okay.

360
01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:33.940
DEEPA RAM: Second: so 31 32

361
01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:36.840
DEEPA RAM: and 33,

362
01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:41.300
DEEPA RAM: not to product no rain.

363
01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:16.430
DEEPA RAM: so i'm trying to keep the messages. It's 4 different things connected. So you you You can imagine how that's going to be like, so i'll try to put them as

364
01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:19.269
tip to

365
01:11:23.130 --> 01:11:24.440
and correct.

366
01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:44.280
DEEPA RAM: Yeah. So say this.

367
01:11:51.370 --> 01:11:52.110
DEEPA RAM: Okay.

368
01:11:52.130 --> 01:11:56.729
DEEPA RAM: I've put them as my roommate, as you mentioned. There. There's a mirror here right in the center.

369
01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:59.730
DEEPA RAM: So this is how you will see them as

370
01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:04.690
DEEPA RAM: I decide on whether they would superimpose or not. So i'm going to keep one on top of the other one.

371
01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:08.319
DEEPA RAM: and see if the pots match or not.

372
01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:12.099
DEEPA RAM: and decide whether it has a plan of symmetry or not.

373
01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:15.909
DEEPA RAM: What we can see?

374
01:12:16.190 --> 01:12:16.750
DEEPA RAM: Okay.

375
01:12:44.770 --> 01:12:49.130
DEEPA RAM: So you can answer 34, 35 and 36, and also 37

376
01:12:54.090 --> 01:12:59.699
DEEPA RAM: it's the cover of the center. It's got 4 different items a group of atoms connected to it.

377
01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:01.929
Okay.

378
01:13:22.090 --> 01:13:26.059
DEEPA RAM: Now let me make this model. By the time you've finished other questions.

379
01:13:45.730 --> 01:13:49.800
DEEPA RAM: So it's you turn to all. So there should be 4 carbons.

380
01:14:10.630 --> 01:14:12.410
DEEPA RAM: I think 4 carbons.

381
01:14:12.850 --> 01:14:17.240
DEEPA RAM: and then on the second car. But there should be no H.

382
01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:21.529
DEEPA RAM: Right. So oxygen is this red? Okay?

383
01:14:22.430 --> 01:14:27.750
DEEPA RAM: So i'm going to fix on the second carbon, which is this carbon. I'm going to fix an option

384
01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:31.030
DEEPA RAM: with a hydrogen.

385
01:14:33.070 --> 01:14:37.900
DEEPA RAM: but oxygen with the hydrogen. I can't. You can see here.

386
01:14:38.330 --> 01:14:39.119
DEEPA RAM: all right.

387
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:42.559
DEEPA RAM: So carbon number one.

388
01:14:43.490 --> 01:14:44.790
DEEPA RAM: which is this one

389
01:14:46.030 --> 01:14:46.769
DEEPA RAM: right?

390
01:14:47.610 --> 01:14:51.079
DEEPA RAM: Carbon number 2 is this one

391
01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:54.390
DEEPA RAM: you want to see? It's common number 2

392
01:14:54.750 --> 01:14:55.530
DEEPA RAM: right.

393
01:14:55.650 --> 01:15:01.289
DEEPA RAM: and that is, got an oxygen that carbon is connected to an oxygen with a hydrogen.

394
01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:04.080
DEEPA RAM: Okay, so it's carbon number 2

395
01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:05.300
DEEPA RAM: with

396
01:15:05.490 --> 01:15:06.709
DEEPA RAM: an oxygen.

397
01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:09.880
DEEPA RAM: and to it. Okay.

398
01:15:09.950 --> 01:15:12.869
DEEPA RAM: and then you have good cover. Number 3 and carbon number 4

399
01:15:13.230 --> 01:15:13.860
DEEPA RAM: bye.

400
01:15:19.070 --> 01:15:23.040
DEEPA RAM: The rest is that should all be filled with higher hydrogen, which i'm not doing.

401
01:15:25.140 --> 01:15:27.050
DEEPA RAM: You know that they are all

402
01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:35.210
DEEPA RAM: so. Second, carbon will have a. No. H:

403
01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:46.260
Okay.

404
01:15:46.530 --> 01:15:48.150
DEEPA RAM: It's what I is.

405
01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:54.019
Okay?

406
01:15:54.270 --> 01:15:55.190
DEEPA RAM: Oh, good

407
01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:57.790
DEEPA RAM: Hope. You can see it in detail.

408
01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:12.210
DEEPA RAM: So this is a second call.

409
01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:15.479
DEEPA RAM: and it has got that oxygen and her addition to it.

410
01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:16.950
Okay.

411
01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:24.670
DEEPA RAM: Now, when you are drawing

412
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.960
DEEPA RAM: the bench and dash, which

413
01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:30.049
DEEPA RAM: structure of but 10 to all.

414
01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:34.619
DEEPA RAM: just concentrate on this carbon. So the carbon having the okay.

415
01:16:34.730 --> 01:16:35.500
DEEPA RAM: Okay.

416
01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:37.830
DEEPA RAM: So carbon having the O,

417
01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:40.720
DEEPA RAM: what are the connections on that carbon

418
01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:43.839
DEEPA RAM: the carbon has got to. Oh, h connected to it

419
01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:46.220
DEEPA RAM: a hydrogen connected to it.

420
01:16:46.410 --> 01:16:52.820
DEEPA RAM: The whole of this card, which is any tile part connected to it. We just see h, 2, C. H, 3, okay.

421
01:16:53.100 --> 01:17:04.299
DEEPA RAM: and a meat tile connected to it. See h, 3. So there's a. C. H. 3, that is, a. C. H. 3, that is a no hedge, and to hydrogen connected to that carbon

422
01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:05.730
DEEPA RAM: She can just

423
01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:07.629
DEEPA RAM: draw that carbon.

424
01:17:07.740 --> 01:17:16.660
DEEPA RAM: Put the 4 bonds around it, where to our single lines and the other 2 are veg line, which a dash which lines okay.

425
01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:21.779
DEEPA RAM: And then on those 4 of them. You can put them as whole

426
01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:23.210
DEEPA RAM: like. Oh, h.

427
01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:24.550
DEEPA RAM: h.

428
01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:28.189
DEEPA RAM: C, h, 2, c, h, 3, and C. H 3.

429
01:17:31.610 --> 01:17:34.020
DEEPA RAM: I don't mind if you draw it this way also.

430
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.790
DEEPA RAM: but

431
01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:37.359
DEEPA RAM: that will be an easy way to draw it.

432
01:17:37.510 --> 01:17:40.909
DEEPA RAM: So then it's You'll be able to draw them in a room. Age also.

433
01:17:43.530 --> 01:17:49.440
DEEPA RAM: so mirror image should look exactly like a mirror image of the one you have drawn on the left hand side.

434
01:17:52.230 --> 01:17:52.929
Okay.

435
01:17:53.850 --> 01:18:00.010
DEEPA RAM: So draw the left one first, and then, looking at that, draw the my roommate on the right box.

436
01:18:06.710 --> 01:18:10.400
DEEPA RAM: If you're good enough, and drawing in more view, you can go ahead

437
01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:12.949
DEEPA RAM: and then crop and put them in Asia.

438
01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:14.760
DEEPA RAM: Not the way of doing it.

439
01:18:19.220 --> 01:18:20.010
DEEPA RAM: Okay.

440
01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:28.039
DEEPA RAM: And the second one there is 2 bromo, butane. So instead of the oh, it is a broom. That's the only difference.

441
01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:31.830
DEEPA RAM: Okay, a Brahmin in place of the oh.

442
01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:34.280
DEEPA RAM: so you get a similar kind of a.

443
01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:39.440
DEEPA RAM: a, a, an original and a.

444
01:18:43.290 --> 01:18:44.550
DEEPA RAM: Yeah, so.

445
01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:46.500
DEEPA RAM: And it's showing that

446
01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:53.379
DEEPA RAM: can give you 5 min for that. You will take 5 min to do it.

447
01:18:54.810 --> 01:18:56.390
DEEPA RAM: So take your time control.

448
01:18:56.570 --> 01:18:58.640
DEEPA RAM: I will not disturb you for 5 min.

449
01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:06.450
DEEPA RAM: Done

450
01:25:12.300 --> 01:25:13.599
DEEPA RAM: one to the next.

451
01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:43.910
DEEPA RAM: Okay. So just moving on to the next one

452
01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:50.599
DEEPA RAM: to promote it one also. Let me just make it. Okay.

453
01:26:29.370 --> 01:26:31.480
DEEPA RAM: It's how the molecule looks like

454
01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:36.240
DEEPA RAM: it's. It can means it is 2 carbons. Okay.

455
01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:39.189
DEEPA RAM: the first carbon is this one?

456
01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:40.110
DEEPA RAM: Okay.

457
01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:43.970
DEEPA RAM: we just got an okay connected to it, and 2 hydrogen's.

458
01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:48.650
DEEPA RAM: The other carbon has got a promin with 2 hydrogen.

459
01:26:49.970 --> 01:26:52.130
DEEPA RAM: You can also keep it like this.

460
01:26:53.330 --> 01:26:55.549
DEEPA RAM: and you can also find

461
01:26:58.560 --> 01:26:59.980
DEEPA RAM: plane of symmetry.

462
01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:13.290
DEEPA RAM: Okay.

463
01:27:13.850 --> 01:27:15.580
DEEPA RAM: you find a studio center.

464
01:27:15.700 --> 01:27:20.830
DEEPA RAM: This carbon has got 2 hydrogens. Now the carbon also has got 2 hydrogen.

465
01:27:22.710 --> 01:27:25.040
DEEPA RAM: So now we can draw the structure

466
01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:26.400
DEEPA RAM: and

467
01:27:27.630 --> 01:27:30.499
DEEPA RAM: see whether you find a studio center or not.

468
01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:33.849
DEEPA RAM: and draw the mirror image.

469
01:27:41.730 --> 01:27:47.189
DEEPA RAM: Yes, if you have completed and submitted, you can leave the meeting no problem. Well, mark your attendance.

470
01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:20.299
DEEPA RAM: Okay, All good.

471
01:28:45.620 --> 01:28:46.569
DEEPA RAM: And they say.

472
01:28:50.230 --> 01:28:54.149
DEEPA RAM: No, we are not comparing at all. There is no question of comparison

473
01:28:55.770 --> 01:28:57.070
DEEPA RAM: they just join.

474
01:28:57.560 --> 01:28:59.929
DEEPA RAM: They tend to all it's

475
01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:02.389
DEEPA RAM: to prom and butane the marimage.

476
01:29:03.230 --> 01:29:08.099
DEEPA RAM: And how many studio centers are present, just the number of studio centers in each. Of them.

477
01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:09.899
DEEPA RAM: Okay, that's it.

478
01:29:15.150 --> 01:29:18.349
DEEPA RAM: Question 42. Okay. Let me check it.

479
01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.949
DEEPA RAM: Just question 42 42. Okay. For the coming questions

480
01:29:26.620 --> 01:29:30.249
DEEPA RAM: at the molecules Carrier. Just comparing the mirror images.

481
01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:33.450
DEEPA RAM: Okay.

482
01:29:35.020 --> 01:29:37.230
DEEPA RAM: the original and the mirror image

483
01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:33.899
DEEPA RAM: go on to the next question.

484
01:32:35.390 --> 01:32:40.600
DEEPA RAM: built the following molecule, and then my roommate.

485
01:32:41.090 --> 01:32:42.550
DEEPA RAM: 2 copies.

486
01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:49.120
DEEPA RAM: It should be to and to promise. Okay.

487
01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:02.139
DEEPA RAM: Okay, that's it.

488
01:33:02.370 --> 01:33:03.340
Okay.

489
01:33:30.110 --> 01:33:38.630
DEEPA RAM: So how many studio centers are present is the only called Kiral. Does it contain a plan of symmetry. You can answer all those questions. I'm not going to help you with anything. Okay.

490
01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:46.470
DEEPA RAM: You've done so many questions now. So you know exactly what? What it is. I'm. Showing you the different

491
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:48.240
DEEPA RAM: from different angle.

492
01:33:54.630 --> 01:33:55.710
DEEPA RAM: Essentially.

493
01:34:06.660 --> 01:34:09.200
DEEPA RAM: as you can see it's like this.

494
01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:18.880
DEEPA RAM: Okay.

495
01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:21.289
DEEPA RAM: and it run.

496
01:34:22.980 --> 01:34:24.729
DEEPA RAM: and again turn it around.

497
01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:39.289
DEEPA RAM: Yes, yes, you only have to talk about.

498
01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:54.440
DEEPA RAM: Okay

499
01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:05.130
DEEPA RAM: done.

500
01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:08.439
DEEPA RAM: We can. Now we can answer the rest of the questions.

501
01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:11.299
DEEPA RAM: I don't think we have.

502
01:40:13.050 --> 01:40:16.110
DEEPA RAM: Yeah, that's all. But that'd be finished.

503
01:40:29.830 --> 01:40:32.279
DEEPA RAM: Do you have any questions or anything?

504
01:40:35.180 --> 01:40:40.140
DEEPA RAM: And if you don't have any questions, you can just leave the meeting, and you can

505
01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:41.730
DEEPA RAM: submit the work.

506
01:40:41.890 --> 01:40:45.100
DEEPA RAM: but make sure that you submit before

507
01:40:45.390 --> 01:40:49.410
DEEPA RAM: 1230, because you don't have time. After that you will be.

508
01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:53.110
You will be applied a late penalty if you sub it up to that.

509
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:56.870
DEEPA RAM: Okay, so make sure that you stop it before 1230.

510
01:40:57.100 --> 01:40:58.680
DEEPA RAM: You've got plenty of time.

511
01:41:11.220 --> 01:41:12.309
Rob Mcneill: Thanks.

512
01:41:12.690 --> 01:41:14.040
DEEPA RAM: See you

513
01:41:39.010 --> 01:41:44.639
DEEPA RAM: not those who are in here. So how? Justin? Why, Sonicole.

514
01:41:44.700 --> 01:41:49.829
DEEPA RAM: Tim, do you have any questions? If not, you can leave no problem.

515
01:41:50.260 --> 01:41:55.389
DEEPA RAM: all good. So please submit before 1230. Make sure that you do that so that you don't

516
01:41:55.660 --> 01:41:58.610
DEEPA RAM: be given any light penalties. Okay.

517
01:42:00.590 --> 01:42:01.550
beautiful.

518
01:42:05.250 --> 01:42:09.519
DEEPA RAM: So, Nicole, are you fine? Just send it to me after you finish the work. Okay.
