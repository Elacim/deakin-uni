### Amount of sig figs
**Addition/Subtraction**
$58.967 - 4.85 = 54.117 = 54.12$

**Multiplication/Division**
$8769.35Pa \times 7.86m^{3} = 68927 = 68900 Pa\text{ }m^{3}$

**Logarithms and Antilogarith**

### Rules for significant figures
Only the *final* resulting number should be in significant figures

**Rule 1**: All nonzero numbers are significant; the number of significant figures depends on the position of any zeros.
- 3.456 has 4 significant figures – as all digits are nonzero, they are all significant.
- $3.2 + 41.365 + 125.2 = 169.765 = 169.8$

**Rule 2**: Zeros in the middle of a number are like any other digit; they are always significant.
- 1008.005 has 7 significant figures – as the zeros are in the middle of the number, they are significant.

**Rule 3**: Zeros at the beginning of a number are never significant; they act only to locate the decimal point.
- 0.00145 has 3 significant figures – the zeros at the beginning of the number are not significant.
- This is more apparent when we use scientific notation e.g. 1.45 x 10-3 has three significant figures the 1, the 4 and the 5. Exponentials (the 10-3 bit) do not count.

**Rule 4**: Zeros at the end of a number, after the decimal point at the end of the number, are significant. These zeros would not be shown unless they were significant.
- 1700.00 has 6 significant figures – the decimal point indicates that the zeros at the end of the number are significant.

**Rule 5**: Zeros at the end of a number where no decimal point is written may or may not be significant – ambiguous.
- 1700 has an ambiguous number of significant figures – as there is no decimal point, we cannot know for certain. Writing such numbers in scientific notation ensures such ambiguity is avoided.
- For example, 17 x 102 implies only two significant figures whereas 170 x 101 implies three significant figures. 1700. with a decimal point at the end of the 1700 might not be something we see much but it implies four significant figures if you were wondering how to write it. 

**Rule 6:** The logarithm or antilogarithm has the same number of figures on the right-hand side of the decimal point as there are significant figures in the number to be logged. This applies to both common (log10)and natural logs (ln).
