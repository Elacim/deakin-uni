Amines are all $NH_{3}$ derivatives 

Nitrogen at centre is $sp^{3}$ hybridised

What are ammonia $H$s replaced by in primary/secondary/tertiary amines? :: A carbon bonded to anything else

**Amine groups**
When is something aromatic? :: When a functional group is bonded to a benzene ring
Aliphatic amine :: An amine where $N$ is bonded only to alkyl groups (not bonded to the benzene ring)
Aromatic :: An amine where $N$ is bonded to aryl groups (the benzene ring)
Heterocyclic :: A benzene ring where a $N$ replaces a $C$
	Not necessary to learn

Aliphatic amines have the same naming as other organic compounds - here is `butan-2-amine`

CC(N)CC

![[(S)-1-phenylethanamine.png]]
(S)-1-phenylethanamine
The benzene ring is named as `phenyl`
The benzene ring is the biggest point of different, so it is labelled as 2, the invisible hydrogen connected to the 1-carbon is 3. We are going anti-clockwise s the orientation is (S)

No dashed wedges means $X$ is behind (usually hydrogen)

$\ce{ H2N(CH2)6NH2 }$
hexane-1,6-diamine

Amine is a suffix and is therefore always last
	Methylamine
	tert-butylamine
	dicyclopentylamine
	triethylamine

**Naming amines**
1. Name the parent chain
2. Add the suffix to the longest-carbon chain name
3. Add the prefix (name substituents)
4. Include locant (substituent numbers)
	1. Write $N$ for any substituents bonded on nitrogen

Amines have all three [[Inter and intramolecular forces]] - they're polar and the primary/secondary amines form hydrogen bonds

$OH$ bonds are stronger than $NH$ bonds due to higher $\chi$ 
Methanol would have a higher boiling point than methanamine due to stronger hydrogen bonding between molecules

1-bromopropane -> propylammonium -> propylamine
$\ce{ CH3CH2CH2Br + NH3 -> CH3CH2CH2\bar{N}H3 + Br-}$ $\ce{ -> + OH- -> CH3CH2CH2NH2 + H2O }$

Nitro - slide 7a

- Any molecule with a nitrogen is a base
- Amines are basic and nucleophillic due to unshaired pair of $e^{-}$
	- Reacts readily with acids, forming salts
		- Electrophillic species (haloalkanes, acyl halides, etc.)
	- Aromatic amines are much weaker bases than aliphatic (SLIDE 8b)
	- Insoluble amines vs soluble amines react with acid just the same
		- salts are formed
		- This allows separation from water-insoluble/non-basic componds (e.g. ethers)

Amines react with acid chlorides or carboxylic anhydrides to form amides
