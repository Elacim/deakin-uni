What is a dynamic equilibrium? :: A reversible reaction where products become reactants and reactants products at an equal rate

If dynamic equilibrium is reached between two molecular compounds, what are the possible values for concentration? :: One compound may have a higher concentration than another, not before flip-flopping back and forth (most likely) OR the concentrations will be exactly equal

Why is a dynamic equilibrium 'dynamic'? :: When a reaction is at equilibrium, it is still active. The products are turning into the reactants and vice versa at an equal rate.

What does an overall system composition of equalised concentrations not depend on? :: The order of adding concentrations (it is a state function)

#### Question
$_{gas}: \ce{ CO_{(g)} + H2O_{(g)} <=> CO_{2(g)} + H2_(g)}$
$\Delta H^{\theta} = -41.2kJ$
What will happen to the concentration of $CO_{2 (g)}$ if the temperature is decreased?
The concentration will increase.
Think about the number line. As the temperature decreases, the equilibrium will be out of whack, so to work towards equilibrium, the reaction shifts right, favouring the product until equilibrium is reached. 
###### Answer from Moodle
The concentration will increase.
The reaction is exothermic. When temperature is decreased the equilibrium will shift to partially compensate for the temperature decrease. In order to do this the reaction will shift in the exothermic direction. In this case, this shift results in an increase of the concentration of the products.






### Writing $K_{c}$ expressions
Write $_{aq}:\ce{ AgCl_{(s)} + 2NH3 <=> Ag(NH3)+2 + Cl- }$ as a $K_{c}$ expression
?
$_{aq}:\ce{ AgCl_{(s)} + 2NH3 <=> Ag(NH3)+2 + Cl- }$
Cancel out any pure solids/liquids to get:
$K_{c} = \ce{ \frac{ [Ag(NH3)+2] [Cl-] }{ [2NH3] } }$

Write $_{solid}: \ce{ P4 + 3O2_{(g)} <=> P4O6 }$ as a $K_{c}$ expression
?
$_{solid}: \ce{ P4 + 3O2_{(g)} <=> P4O6 }$
Cancel out the pure solids to get
$K_{c} = \frac{1}{[O_{2}]^{3}}$
