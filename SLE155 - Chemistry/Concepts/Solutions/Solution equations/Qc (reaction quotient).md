$aA + bB \leftrightarrow cC + dD$
-> $Q_{c} = \frac{ [C]^{c} [D]^{d} }{ [A]^{a} [B]^{b} }$

What does $Q_{c}$ signify? :: Symbol for the system at any point in a reaction (reaction quotient)
$K_{c}$ vs $Q_{c}$ :: $K_{c}$ tells us the system's [[Equilibrium]] value while $Q_{c}$ tells us if we are at that value 

What does $Q=K$ state? ::: Equilibrium (in terms of $Q$ and $K$)
What does $Q < K$ state? ::: A shift towards products (in terms of $Q$ and $K$); not in equilibrium
What does $Q > K$ state? ::: A shift towards reactants (in terms of $Q$ and $K$); not in equilibrium

What is the anatomy of $[A]^{a}$? :: The concentration of a molecule (e.g. $3H_{2}$) raised to the coefficient ($3$) -> $[H_{2}]^{3}$

How would $Q_{c}$ change over a 10 minute long reaction? :: It would change until the 10 minute mark and then it would stop changing after this time
What is the range of $Q_{c}$? :: Any positive value
What does the $_{c}$ in $Q_{c}$ signify? :: The equation is in regards to concentration

##### Example
At 460C, the reaction $\ce{G: SO2 + NO2 <=> NO + SO3}$ has a $K_{c}$ of $85.0$. Given $\ce{[SO2]=0.00250M | [NO2]=0.00350M}$ and $\ce{[NO]=0.0250M | [SO3]=0.0400M}$, state if the mixture is in equilibrium.
$\ce{K_{c} = \frac{ [NO][SO3] }{ [SO2][NO2] } = 85.0}$
$\ce{Q_{c} = \frac{ [NO][SO3] }{ [SO2][NO2] }}$ = $\frac{0.0250 \times 0.0400}{0.00250 \times 0.00350} = 114.28 = 114$
$\ce{Q_{c} > K_{c}}$, so the reaction is not at equilibrium
To reach equilibirum, the system would shift to the 'left' towards the reactants, making $Q_{c}$ smaller and reach the $K_{c}$ value
