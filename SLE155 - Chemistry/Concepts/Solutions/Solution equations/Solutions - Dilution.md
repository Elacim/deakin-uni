Why do we need to find $n$ in dilution problems, given $C$ is already given to us? :: If we simply add more litres to the equation, like $C=\frac{n}{V + \text{ new litres}}$, we will not be finding the new value of $C$ and instead be calculating a bogus value of $n$

Given 500mL of a 1M glucose solution, what would the concentration be when 500mL more water is added? :: To find the new concentration, we'll need the value of $1_{M}=\frac{n}{0.5L} \rightarrow n=0.5mol$; from this, $C=\frac{0.5mol}{1L}=0.5_{M}$, which is half the concentration of $1_{M}$

20ml of a 0.25M solution is diluted by adding another 480ml of liquid, what is the new concentration in M (mol/L)? :: $0.25_{M}=\frac{n}{0.02L} \rightarrow 0.25_{M} \times 0.02L=0.005mol$; $C = \frac{0.005mol}{0.02L + 0.480L}=0.0073529412_{M}=0.01_{M}$

20ml of a 0.25M solution is diluted to 500ml, what is the new concentration in M (mol/L)? :: $n=0.25_{M} \times 0.02L=0.005mol$; $C=\frac{0.005mol}{0.5L} = 0.01_{M,L}$

A “stock” solution contained 318g of $NaCO_{3}$ ($M_{r}=82.998$) in 1L of solution. 50ml of the “stock” solution was diluted to 250ml. What is the concentration of the final solution in g/L and M (mol/L)
?
$C_{1}V_{1}=C_{2}V_{2}$
$\frac{318g}{1L}=318g/L$
$\frac{318g}{82.998u}=3.8314mol$ -> $C=\frac{3.8314mol}{1L}=3.8314_{M,L}$
$3.8314 \times 1L=C_{2} \times 0.25L$ -> $C_{2}=15.3256_{M,L}$

A “stock” solution contained $3.8314_{M,L}$ of $NaCO_{3}$ ($M_{r}=82.998$). 50ml of the “stock” solution was diluted to 250ml. What is the final concentration? :: $3.8314mol \times 0.05L = C_{2} \times 0.25L$; $\frac{3.8314 \times 0.05L}{0.25L}=0.76628_{M,L}$

What is the concentration (g/L) of a 250mL $0.1_{M}NaCl$ solution?
?
$0.1_{M}=\frac{n}{0.25L} \rightarrow 0.025mol$
$NaCl=58.43976 M_{r}$ -> $M_{r} \times 0.025mol = 1.460994 = 1.5$ grams/L
