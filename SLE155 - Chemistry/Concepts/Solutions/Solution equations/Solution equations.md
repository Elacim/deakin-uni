What is 'molar concentration'? :: The moles per litre of solution ($C=$ mol/L)
What is the unit for $C$ (concentration)? :: mol/L, known as the molar concentration
What is the equation for concentration in moles? :: $C \text{ (mol/L)}=\frac{n \text{ (mol)}}{V \text{ (L)}}$
What is the equation for concentration in grams? :: $C \text{ (grams/L)}=\frac{m \text{ (grams)}}{V \text{ (L)}}$
What is the equation for finding $n$ from $V$ and $C$? :: $n=CV$
What is the equation for finding $V$ from $n$ and $C$? :: $V=\frac{n}{C}$
What does $mol$ $L^{-1}$ mean? :: The amount of moles per litre ($C=\frac{n}{V}$)

$C_{1}V_{1}=C_{2}V_{2}$

What are the two equations needed to solve any stoichiometric problem? :: $M=\frac{m}{n}$ (Molar Mass (g/mol) = mass (grams) over moles) and $C=\frac{n}{V}$ (Concentration (mol/L) = moles over volume (Litres))

Is 0.1mol and 1L equivalent to 0.01mol and 100mL? :: Yes. $\frac{0.1mol}{1.0L}=0.1mol/L$ and $\frac{0.01mol}{0.1L}=0.1mol/L$
Why is 0.1mol and 1L equivalent to 0.01mol and 100mL? :: Because the ratio is 10:1

What does it mean when a 1L solution has 0.1mol $NaCl$? :: The solution has a molar concentration of $0.1mol/L$ of $NaCl$
What is the molar concentration of $0.05mol$ in $25mL$ of solution? :: $C=\frac{0.05}{25mL \div 1000}=2mol/L$
What is the molar concentration of $0.4mol$ in $2L$ of solution? :: $C=\frac{0.4}{2L}=0.2mol/L$
What is the molar concentration of $6mol$ in $300mL$ of solution? :: $C=\frac{6}{300mL \div 1000}=20mol/L$
What is the molar concentration of $0.01mol$ in $3mL$ of solution? :: $C=\frac{0.01}{3mL \div 1000}=3.3333mol/L$
