### Terminology
A solvent is... :: The liquid dissolving the solute
A solute is... :: The substance dissolved in the solvent
Dissolution is... :: The process of dissolving a solute in a solvent to produce a solution
True or False: Solvents are exclusively liquid :: False, they can be in any state; liquid is presumed unless stated otherwise

**Solute** $\xrightarrow{\text{dissolved in}}$ **Solvent**: Dissolution

**Solution:** Homogenous mixture where two+ substances' atoms/molecules/ions/electrons can move and recombine
	The atmosphere is a gaseous homogenous mixture
	Solid alloys like Bronze are too

What happens to a solute when dissolved in a solvent? :: The solute particles are surrounded by solvent and their individual components dissociated from one another (e.g. $\ce{CaF2_{(s)}<=> C^{2+} + 2F-}$)  

The appearance of solutions tends to be... :: Near to completely transparent 

Even though pressure decreases, the composition would remain the same
	- Air would mostly remain the same in different areas
### Polarity
Polar solutes dissolve in polar solvents (e.g. sugar in water)
Non-polar solutes dissolve in non-polar solvents
Polar solutes do NOT dissolve in non-polar solvents
	Ionic solids/very polar molecules like sugar can't dissolve in non-polar solvents
	This is due to the non-polar solvents being unable to attract the ions/molecules due to low polarisability
