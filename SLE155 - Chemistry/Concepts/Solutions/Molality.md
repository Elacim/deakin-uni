What effect does increased temperature have on solutions? :: The concentration can change due to the temperature increasing volume
Molality formula :: $\frac{ \text{moles of solute} }{ \text{kilograms of solvent} }$

What is molality? :: The amount of solute (moles) per kilogramme of solvent ($\frac{n}{\text{kg}}$)

What is the significance of molality compared to molarity? :: Molality is temperature independent

How is molality temperature independent? :: It divides by mass, which unlike dividing by litres ($C=\frac{n}{V}$), is temperature independent

What is the shorthand for molality? :: No shorthand like molarity being $M$, it is simply $\text{mol kg}^{-1}$
