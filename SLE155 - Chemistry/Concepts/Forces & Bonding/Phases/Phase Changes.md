# Phase Changes
What is the definition of a solid?
??
- definite shape and volume
- it cannot be compressed 
- Malleable
- The atoms are arranged in a regular pattern and are tight knit
- The bonds may be covalent, ionic, or metallic

What is the definition of a liquid?
??
- Definite volume, with a shape that fills a given container
- It cannot be compressed
- The atoms are close but not organised. 
- They may be affected by Van Der Waal forces, electrostatic forces, or hydrogen bonds.

What is the definition of a gas?
??
- Variable volume and shape
- Expands to fill a container
- Can be easily compressed
- Atoms are far apart from each other and are free to move independently

# Types of Changes
Chemical, physical, and nuclear changes all involve matter. 
Matter - touch/taste/smell/see - may not be able to due to small quantities
	- Property. A char. for identifying a substance or object (such as size, colour, temp, chem. comp, and chem. reactivity, boiling temp.)
### Chemical
- Chemical change - e.g. petrol burning -> water, toxic fumes, lots of energy
	- Same number of protons and neutrons, only electrons change spots

| **Chemical changes** | Examples                                                 |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Oxidisation          | Iron to rust                                             |
| Acid-base            | Bicarb and vinegar                                       |
| Endo/exothermic      | Absorbing light / Heat pack                              |
| Precipitation        | Silver nitrate (aq) to silver chloride (s)               |
| Dissociation         | $H_{2}O \xrightarrow{\text{electric current}} H_{2} + O$ |
| Chemiluminescence    | Glow worms                                               |

### Physical
 Physical change - when from one matter to another in a different state (e.g. breaking a glass sheet). Phase changes (boiling water -> steam)
	- Water turning into steam is still the same water molecules (H2O(l) -> h2O(g), not dissociating into H and O)

### Nuclear
- Nuclear reactions
	- Fission, fusion, decay
	- Protons, neutrons, and electrons can move around
