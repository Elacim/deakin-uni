What is an ionic compound? :: An extremely polar covalent bond between a metal cation and a non-metal anion that form a neutral compound 

How are ions named? :: The cation then the anion, e.g. `magnesium sulfate`

True or False: Ions are always polar :: True.

#### Bonds
What is the meaning of ions being isotropic? :: The anions and cations are attracted to each other and surrounding atoms equally

Does complete (clean) ionic bonding exist?
?
The complete transference of electrons (clean ionic bonding) does not exist. Sharing/covalency is always present in some way.
Electrons can completely transfer to individual ions.

Ionic compounds are compounds (not molecules) consisting of two or more atoms completely transferring or accepting electrons.
$\ce{Na + Cl -> Na+ + Cl- -> Na+Cl- -> NaCl}$
The sodium and chlorine now have more stable valence shells. 


#### Cations and anions
Ions can have a positive or negative charge.
Cations are ions with a positive charge (e.g. Na${^+}$) - Cats are positive
Anions are ions with a negative charge (e.g. NO$^{3-}$) - 'An' means anti means anti-positive

An atom that loses electrons is a(n)... :: Cation
An atom that loses electrons is a(n)... :: Anion
