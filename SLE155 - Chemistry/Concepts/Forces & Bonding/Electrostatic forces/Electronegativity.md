Symbol for electronegativity :: $\chi$ (chi)

? :: Numerical values of strength of atom attracting electrons in a given bond. 
What do higher values indicate? :: The atom is more electronegative and it will be more likely to accept electrons
What do lower values indicate? :: The atom is less electronegative and it will be more likely to donate electrons

Minimum value :: $0.0$
Maximum value :: $4.0$
Most electronegative atom :: $\ce{Fluorine}$

$\chi$ is for neutral atoms, not ions

How does electronegativity affect electron density? :: Greater $\chi$ attracts greater shares of electrons
