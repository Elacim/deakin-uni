TODO: Find [[Hybridisation]] of all types of geometry

What does **VSEPR** stand for? :: Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion theory
What does the VSEPR theory posit? :: That molecular shape is determine by electron pair repulsions; electron pair count affects how far apart these pairs are
Why do electron pairs locate to a position as far as possible from other pairs? :: They do this to minimise repulsion; find an equilibrium

What does **BP** stand for? :: Bonding pairs
What does **LP** stand for? :: Lone pairs
Which pairing type has the most important repulsion type? :: Lone pair to lone pair repulsions
Which pairing type has the least important repulsion type? :: Bonding pair to bonding pair repulsions
Do LPs take up much space? :: They take up a fair bit - more than bonding pairs in fact. This has the side-effect of pushing bonding pairs closer than usual.


What shape is found by two sets of electron pairs? :: Linear
What shape is found by three sets of electron pairs? :: Trigonal plane
What shape is found by four sets of electron pairs? :: Tetrahedral
What shape is found by five sets of electron pairs? :: Trigonal bipyramidal
What shape is found by six sets of electron pairs? :: Octahedral

What makes a trigonal planar configuration planar? :: The lack of lone pairs of electrons
What makes a trigonal pyramidal configuration pyramidal? :: A lone pair of electrons


What configuration does this image represent? ![[VSEPR theory - Trigonal pyramidal.png|200]] :: Trigonal pyramidal

What configuration does this image represent? ![[VSEPR theory - Trigonal planar.png|200]] :: Trigonal planar


What configuration is $NH_{3}$ (ammonia)? :: Trigonal pyramidal as $N$ has a lone pair of $e^{-}$
In regards to the periodic table, where do trigonal pyramidal structures tend to show up? :: In group 15 elements (not a definite rule)
In regards to the periodic table, where do trigonal planar structures tend to show up? :: In group 13 elements with no double bonds (not a definite rule) 


When is a molecule tetrahedral? :: When it has 4 atoms with 0 lone pairs surrounding a central atom (5 total atoms)
When is a molecule trigonal pyramidal? :: 4 total atoms; 3 atoms with zero lone pairs; central with one lone pair
When it has 3 atoms with 0 lone pairs surrounding a central atom with 1 lone pair (4 total atoms)
When is a molecule bent? :: 3 total atoms; 2 atoms with zero lone pairs; central with two lone pairs
