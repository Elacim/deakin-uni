What makes a trigonal planar configuration planar? :: The lack of lone pairs of electrons

Are there different trigonal planar configurations? :: No, they are all resonance structures

How many electron pairs does a trigonal planar molecule have? :: Three sets of electron pairs

What is the angle between atoms in a trigonal planar configuration? :: $120Â°$

What must the centre atom of a trigonal planar configuration not have for the configuration to be deemed trigonal planar?
?
