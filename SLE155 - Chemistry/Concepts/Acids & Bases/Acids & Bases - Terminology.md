Alkali name origin :: The arabic *al-qaliy*, meaning *the ashes*. Named so for the ashes of saltwort plants which grow in alkaline soils.

$pKa$ vs. $pH$ :: $pKa$ is the acidity of a compound whereas $pH$ is the acidity of a solution

A strong acid is at or below... :: A pH of 3 or below ($<3$)
A strong base it at or above... :: A pH of 11 or above ($>11$)

What is the formula for finding pH? :: $pH=-log([H_{3}O^{+}])$
What is the formula for finding pOH? :: $pOH=-log([OH^{-}])$

What formula can be used to find pH or pOH, depending on which is available? :: $14 = pH + pOH$
What formula is used to find the concentration of $H_{3}O^{+}$ ions? :: $K_{w}= 1.0 \times 10^{14}$


**Dissociation constants:**
- $K_{a}=\frac{ [H_{3}O^{+}][A^{-}] }{ [HA] }$
	- e.g. $K_{a} = 1\times10^{-5}$ means ~0.1% of molecules in a 0.1M solution are dissociated
- $K_{b}=\frac{ [HB^{+}][OH^{-}] }{ [B] }$ or $K^{'}_{b}=\frac{ [HA][OH^{-}] }{ [A^{-}] }$
- $K_{w} = K_{a}K_{b}^{'}$

- $pK_{a} = -log(K_{a})$ and $K_{a}=10^{-pKa}$
	- water = 
	- Low pKa = strong acid, high = strong base
- $pK_{b} = -log(K_{b})$ and $K_{b}=10^{-pKb}$
- $pK_{a} + pK_{b} = 14.00$ at $25\degree$C

What does the $p$ in $pK_{a}/pK_{b}$ tell us? :: That the things after it after have the negative log taken of them (so it translates to $-log(K_{a})$)

What does a low value (<0) of $pK_{a}$ tell us? :: The acid does not have a tight grip on it's proton
What does a higher value (>0) of $pK_{a}$ tell us? :: The acid has a tight grip on it's proton

What does a large value of $K_{a}$ mean? :: The acid is strong and is therefore more dissociative
