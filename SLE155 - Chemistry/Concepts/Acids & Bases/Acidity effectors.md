##### CARDIO
**C**harge
**A**tomic size
**R**esonance
**D**ipole **I**nduction
**O**rbitals

##### Atomic charge
Removing a proton from a molecule/atom with a positive ($+$) [[Formal Charges|formal charge]]  is easier than a molecule/atom with no or a negative ($-$) charge

##### Bond lengths and atomic size
A trend in the [[Periodic Table trends and structure#Acidity|periodic table]] shows atoms across rows and down groups show more acidity. 

This is hypothesised to be because of increasing atomic size. The shorter, stronger bonds that low radius elements can form may lead to less willingness to donate protons.

##### [[Resonance]] 
More resonance structures lead to a higher acidity. 

##### Dipole induction
[[Electronegativity|Electronegative]] atoms shift the electron density cloud towards them, increasing the acidity of nearby atoms.
#question is this why?

##### [[Orbitals]] 
The more $s$-character a [[Hybridisation|hybridised]] orbital has, the more acidic it is.
