Would mixing $HCl$ and $NaOH$ result an acidic, basic, or neutral solution? :: A neutral solution (strong acid + strong base = neutral)
Would mixing $HCl$ and $NH_{3}$ result an acidic, basic, or neutral solution? :: A weakly acidic solution (strong acid + weak base = weak acid)
Would mixing $HNO_{2}$ and $NaOH$ result an acidic, basic, or neutral solution? :: A basic solution (weak acid + strong base = weak base)
Would mixing $HNO_{2}$ and $HCl$ result an acidic, basic, or neutral solution? :: An acidic solution (weak acid + strong acid = acidic)
