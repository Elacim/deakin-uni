$\ce{HI}$ has such a high $pK_a$ due to it's large size. The negative charge of the electrons is spread over this size, making the bond to the $\ce{H}$ weaker due to a lesser concentration. It therefore has a weaker grip on the proton.

Note: Some of these values are too broad to be fully accurate. According to this chart, `methanol` should be more basic than water, but it actually is slightly more acidic as it doesn't account for it being a primary alcohol rather than secondary/tertiary alcohol
