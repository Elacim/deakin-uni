Open system :: Can gain/lose mass/energy across their boundaries
Closed system :: Can absorb/release energy, but not mass, across the boundary
Isolated system :: Cannot exchange matter/energy with surroundings
Exergonic :: Energy into surroundings
Endergonic :: Energy needed from surroundings
- A spontaneous process is $-\Delta G$ and does not need external aid; exergonic
- A non-spontaneous process is $+\Delta G$ and needs external aid; endergonic

- Most reactions are performed under constant pressure

###### Lingo
$q$ = heat - the heat that is transferred to or from the system
- Can be $q_{p}$ if external pressure is constant
	-  $q_{p} = \Delta H$
$w$ = work - the work done on or by the system
- $+ve$ = energy in; $-ve$ = energy out

- **Extensive properties** are dependent on the size of a sample
- **Intensive properties** are the same, regardless of sample size


###### Heat
$q = C \times \Delta T$
$C$ = heat capacity in joules kelvin

$C_{m} = \frac{C}{n}$
- molar heat capacity of a substance = heat capacity over moles
- $C_{m}$, or molar heat, is in joules/mol/kelvin

###### Work
$w = -p \times \Delta V$
	- work in $J/L$ = -(pressure in pascals) $\times$ the change in volume ($L$)
	- Divide by $1000$ to get the total number of Joules

###### Change in internal energy
- $\Delta U / \Delta E$
- $\Delta U = q + w$
- State function, where $q$ and $w$ can be in any position and the same result is reached

###### Enthalpy
$\Delta H$ (change in heat flow, $\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$)
	Can be $\Delta_{r}H$
$\Delta H = q_{p}$
$\Delta H < 0$ = exothermic (energy released) ($Q>K$)
$\Delta H > 0$ = endothermic (energy absorbed) ($Q<K$)

Going right = negative kJ
Going left = positive kJ

**Exothermic**:
> A reaction will go exothermic with **excess** energy
> Favoured by the system at high temperatures
   **REACTANTS** are favoured

**Endothermic**
> A reaction will go endothermic with a **scarcity** of energy
   Favoured by the system at lower temperatures
   **PRODUCTS** are favoured



###### Entropy
[[SLE133 - Chemistry in Our World/Weeks/Week 9 - Chemical Thermodynamics/Week 9 - Notes#Entropy]]
$\Delta S$ (change in entropy, $\text{J/mol/K}$)
- $\Delta S = S_{products} - S_{reactants}$ (J/mol/K)
- State function
- Solids = low entropy, gases = high entropy

$S_{total} = - \frac{H_{vap}}{T} + S_{vap}$    $\S$
- Convert $\Delta H(H_{vap})$ to joules
- $S_{total}$ and $S_{vap}$ is in Joules/mol
	e.g. =$- \frac{ 5.72kJ \times 1000 }{ 23.3Â°C + 273.15 } + 274J = 254.705 = 255J/K/mol$

###### Gibb's Free Energy
- $\Delta G = \Delta H - (T \times \Delta S)$
	Not sure: $G(p,T) = U + pV - (TS) = H - (TS)$
- kJ/mol
- Make sure $H$ and (especially) $S$ are in kJ/mol, not J/mol
	- And be careful to add negatives, it leads to completely different answers if needed and you go without them (not a simple sign flip)
$\Delta G < 0$ = spontaneous
$\Delta G > 0$ = **non**-spontaneous
$\Delta G = 0$ = at equilibrium
When $\Delta H$ and $\Delta S$ have the same sign (+ or -), the value of $T$ determines $\Delta G$ 
Solving for temperature $\frac{\Delta G - \Delta H}{\Delta S} = T$
