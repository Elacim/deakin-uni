Steric effects are the effects that the different spatial arrangements of atoms has on a compound's [[Physical properties|physical]] and [[Chemical properties|chemical properties]] 

Steric bulk :: The amount of space atoms take up; a bulky compound
Steric strain :: Strain put on a molecule due to it's configuration

##### Steric hindrance
The slowing down of chemical reactions due to steric bulk (blocking compounds)

It is used in chemistry to slow down side-reactions that produce an undesirable product
