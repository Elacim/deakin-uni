Do molecules readily shift from cis to trans and vice versa? :: No, to swap, they need to break bonds and reform, meaning there is a high energy threshold for this to occur

What is cis-trans isomerism? :: A set of two isomers, one (cis) on the same side of a double bond and the other (trans) on the opposite sides of the double bond

What is a trend of cis-trans isomers? :: The tend to be rings or have double bonds

What are the requirements for a cis-trans isomer?
?
1. The molecule has at least one [[Stereocentres|stereocentre]] 
2. There are two groups/substituents attached to two separate carbons (the groups can be the same)

A **cis isomer** has their groups above or below the molecule/ring at the same time
	- e.g. both up
A **trans isomer** has their groups separately above or below the molecule/ring at the same time
	- e.g. one up, one down

Formula for the maximum possible number of cis-trans isomers :: $2^{n}$, where $n$ is the number of $\ce{C=C}$ bonds

1,2-dimethylcyclopentane can be one of two isomers. The only difference is a $CH_{3}$ group positioned upwards (trans) and the other downwards (cis)


Which of these show cis-trans isomerism?
![[Geometrical (cis-trans) - question 1.png|350]]
The answer is II, III, and IV
1 is close, but it has the same groups so it can't display cis-trans.
2 is on the same plane -> cis
3 is on the same plane -> cis
4 is on different planes -> trans
5 has only 1 substituent so it can't display cis-trans.
NOTE: THE DARK (THICK) LINE IS NOT A DOUBLE BOND, IT REPRESENTS 3D SPACE


How is this molecule described in cis-trans terms?
![[Cis-trans question 2.png|200]]
It cannot be classified as solely cis-trans
- Methyl cis to ethyl
- Ethyl trans to chloro
- Methyl trans to chloro
