Chirality refers to an (independent) object
Enantiomers/Diastereomers refers to a relationship between two objects

What are stereoisomers? :: Isomers with the same order of attachment of atoms, but the orientation of each differs
*Stereo-* meaning :: 3-dimensions/spatial

Enantiomers are... :: Non-mirrorable molecules
Diastereomers are... :: Non-mirrorable and non-identical molecule

What are carbons when they become chiral carbons? :: Optically active

What is a racemic mixture? :: A 1:1 mixture of left and right-handed molecules

| c + d | Enantiomer |
| a + c | Diasteromers |
| a + d | Diasteromers |
| b + c | Diasteromers |
| b + d | Diasteromers |


### Determining possible stereoisomers
1. Find each chiral centre (4 unique groups)
2. 
### Questions
How many stereoisomers in this compound? ![[Stereoisomers - example 1.png|200]]
?
- Immediately we can discount double bonds and any $\ce{CH2}$ groups.
- As a quick cursory look, we can find all the carbons with only three bonds. 
- Looking at each of these, we can find that they each have 4 unique groups (a hydrogen and 3 other unique groups).
- There are three of these carbons so using the predictive formula $2^{n}$, there are $2^{3} = 8$ possible stereoisomers in this compound.


How many stereoisomers can `butane-2,3-diol`/`2,3-butanediol` have?
?
It can have a maximum of 3. It would be 4, but there is an arrangement that is identical to another, meaning we don't count it.
