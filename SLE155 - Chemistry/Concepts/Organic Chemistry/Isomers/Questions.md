Is $\ce{ (C2H5)3 C CH3 }$ a valid isomer of `octane`? :: Yes. The inner $C$ is attached to 3 ethyl and 1 methyl group
Is $\ce{ (CH3)3 C (C2H5)2 }$ a valid isomer of `octane`? :: No. This can easily be determined by seeing how many species are attached to the inner carbon (5 when it can only be a max of 4) - 3 methyl + 2 ethyls = 5 bonds
Is $\ce{ (C3H7)2 CH CH3 }$ a valid isomer of octane? :: Yes. The inner $C$ is attached to 1 hydrogen, 2 propyl groups, and a methyl group, totalling 4 bonds


#### Cis-trans isomer
Does $\ce{ CH3-CH=CH-CH2CH3 }$ have a cis and trans isomer? :: Yes.
Does $\ce{ CH2I2 }$ have a cis and trans isomer? :: Yes.
Does $\ce{ CH3-CH=CH2 }$ have a valid cis and trans isomer? :: No.
Does $\ce{ CCl2=C-(CH3)2 }$ have a valid cis and trans isomer? :: Yes.
