Cis-trans is more specific than E,Z

1. There are two non-identical groups on each carbon in the double bond
	1. If either carbon's groups are identical, it cannot be cis-trans
2. There is a matching group on both of the carbons in the double bond
	1. e.g. In $\ce{ H-C(CH3)=C-H(CH3) }$, there are two matching groups, the $H$ and the $\ce{ CH3 }$
3. Draw a line going through the double bond (going with the lines) to determine if it is cis or trans
	1. If both groups are on the same side, it is cis, otherwise trans
