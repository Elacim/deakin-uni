What is a requirement of a molecule to be classified as either R/S? :: It must be an enantiomer

What does R stand for? :: Rectus, or right
What does S stand for? :: Sinister, or left

What is the alternative symbol for R configuration? :: A minus sign (-) or $_{\text{D}}$
What is the alternative symbol for S configuration? :: A plus sign (+) or $_{\text{L}}$
What is the difference between R/S and -/+ and $_{\text{D/L}}$? :: R/S refers to [[Stereocentres]], while the others refer to the entire molecule

Multiple centres :: Each one is assigned an R/S configuration

$(I)C(Br)ClH$
1. Look at the four atoms directly attached to the chiral atom (stereogenic centre)
	1. Assign priorities in decreasing order of atomic number (proton count)
		1. If the priorities are the same, follow the branch until there is an atom with a different priority is found
			1. If still the same, choose the more branched one
		2. e.g. $I$, $Br$, $Cl$, then $H$
	3. Designate each group high, medium, low, or lowest
		1. d
	4. Orient the molecule so that the lowest priority group (usually a lone $H$) is pointing away from you
		1. Drawing a curved arrow from high -> low, 
			1. If clockwise: the configuration at the stereogenic centre is $R$ (*rectus*, right)
			2. Anti-clockwise: the configuration is $S$ (*sinister*, left)

(R)-ibuprofen (the inactive enantiomer)
(S)-ibuprofen (the active enantiomer)
Note: 'inactive' does not necessarily mean inactive, it may be active in some other respects
