What is a requirement for something to be chiral? :: **It has to be non-superimposable on it's mirror-image**
It must not have a plane of symmetry anywhere (on individual molecules) 
What is the cause of chirality? :: The presence of a tetrahedral carbon atom bonded to four different groups 

Chiral etymology :: Chiral means `hand` in Greek, chiral means `handedness`
Name for a molecule that does not display chirality :: Achiral/achirality, or meso compound (if with two stereocentres)
What types of isomers are chiral? :: [[Enantiomers]] 

Are most molecules used in organic processes (like in animals or plants) chiral? :: Yes. And there tends to be only one stereoisomer. 

How many stereocentres does the enzyme chymotrypsin have? :: 251, meaning it has $2^{251}$ possible combinations, but only one stereoisomer is used in nature

True or false: An enzyme does not reject a molecule that fits the enzyme's binding site if a few stereocentres are flipped :: False. Enzymes are chiral and therefore need molecules that match exactly. There may be cases where this isn't true and more stereocentres need to be flipped.

### Definitions
###### Chirality
What is a chiral object? :: An object that is not superimposable on it's mirror image

It has four groups attached to a [[#Stereocentre|stereocentre]] carbon that are all unique.
	e.g. $\ce{C(H)(CH3)(OH)}$ is chiral, whereas $\ce{C(H)(CH3)(CH3)}$ is not



### Questions
What would a molecule with two or more of the same groups be classified as? Chiral or achiral? 
?
Achiral. When mirrored then rotated, the mirrored molecule will exactly match with the original
What is the name of the tetrahedral carbon that causes chirality? :: The chiral carbon or the [[Stereocentres|stereocentre]]

True or False: A symmetric molecule is chiral :: False, a molecule must be asymmetrical 

Is this chiral? ![[Chirality - q1.png]] :: No. Split transversally, it is symmetrical. 
Is this chiral? ![[Chirality - q2.png]] :: Yes. Both the $\ce{OH}$ groups have a quaternary carbon.
Is this chiral? ![[Chirality - q3.png]] :: Yes. It visibly does not have a plane of symmetry.

Is this chiral? ![[Chirality - q4.png]] :: Yes. It visibly does not have a plane of symmetry.
### Representing enantiomers

Absolute configuration :: (slide 22b) The exact 3D arrangement of the groups
Finding the absolute configuration of an enantiomer is the same as naming the isomer
Name for the method of naming enantiomers :: The Cahn-Ingold-Prelog convention

Nature makes one variety of a molecule, not all possible enantiomers
There are only D-amino acids, not L
