What is a benzene? :: A cyclohexene with 3 double $\ce{C=C}$ bonds

What is an arene? :: A compound containing a benzene ring
What is an aromatic? :: A compound containing a benzene OR benzene derivative ring
Difference between arene and aromatic :: Every arene is an aromatic whereas an aromatic can be benzene-adjacent too: $\text{Arene} \subset \text{Aromatic}$ (Arenes are a subset of aromatics)


What is an aryl? :: A benzene with an $\ce{R}$ group
What is a phenyl? :: A benzene with an $\ce{OH}$ group

Benzenes need catalysts to react ([[Aromatic reactions]]) unless it is a strong reagent like sulfuric acid ($\ce{H2SO4}$)

Substituent name then `benzene` unless given an IUPAC name

What is the IUPAC name for methylbenzene ($CH_{3}$)? :: Toluene
What is the IUPAC name for hydroxybenzene ($OH$)? :: Phenol 
What is the IUPAC name for aminobenzene ($NH_{2})$? :: Aniline

With $2$ substituents in a benzene, use numberings or ortho/meta/para,
with $\geq 3$, use numbers

\[1/2] Alternate name for `1,2-dibromobenze` ::: \[2/2] What is/are the numberings (e.g. `4,2`) for `ortho-dibromobenzene`?
\[1/2] Alternate name for `1,3-dibromobenze` ::: \[2/2] What is/are the numberings (e.g. `4,2`) for `meta-dibromobenzene`?
\[1/2] Alternate name for `1,4-dibromobenze` ::: \[2/2] What is/are the numberings (e.g. `4,2`) for `para-dibromobenzene`?
Para meaning :: Opposite positions

#### Aroma rules
Stack exchange question: [Difference between any arene and an aromatic compound?](https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/19284/difference-between-any-arene-and-an-aromatic-compound)
	Solution: https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/a/26250

- The molecule is cyclic (a ring of atoms)
- The molecule is planar (all atoms in the molecule lie in the same plane)
- The molecule is fully conjugated (p orbitals at every atom in the ring)
- The molecule has 4n+2 $\pi$ electrons (n=0 or any positive integer)
