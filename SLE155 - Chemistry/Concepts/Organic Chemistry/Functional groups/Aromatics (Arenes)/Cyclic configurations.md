Which configuration is more stable? :: The chair configuration

What is the common configuration for six-carbon rings? :: The chair or boat configuration

Boat configuration appearance :: It looks like a paper boat with two wings on the side and a flat middle
Chair configuration :: It vagues of a chair


Why is the boat configuration relatively unstable?
?
The hydrogens want to repel against each other but they instead 'eclipse', creating [[Steric effects|steric strain]].

Why is the chair configuration stable? :: The carbons have a bond angle to each other of $\approx\ce{111.4\degree}$ which is close to the ideal bond angle of $\ce{\approx109.5\degree}$, resulting in less steric strain
