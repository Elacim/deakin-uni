The parent chain is named from the longest chain with the carbonyl group

Aldehyde suffix :: *-al*
Aldehyde prefix :: *oxo-*

Ketone suffix :: *-one*
Ketone prefix :: *oxo-*

Carboxyl suffix :: *-oic acid*
Carboxyl prefix :: No prefix
Double carboxyl suffix :: *-dioic acid*

Carboxyls are favoured over most other functional groups, it's derivatives are only more favoured.
