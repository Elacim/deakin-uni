##### [[Acid (acyl) halides]] 
Most basic acid chloride to carboxylic acid formula
	$\ce{CH3C(=O)Cl + H2O \ce{->} CH3C(=O)OH + HCl}$
Formula for acid halide hydrolysis :: $\ce{Acyl halide + H2O \ce{->} Carb. acid + HX}$

How do low-molar-mass acid chlorides react with water? :: Rapidly
How do high-molar-mass acid chlorides react with water? :: Slowly/slower

Are acid halides highly reactive? :: Yes, even at high masses, though the reactions are slower

![[Reactions of carboxylic acids - acid chlorides.png]]

##### [[Acid (acyl) anhydrides]]
Formula for acid anhydride hydrolysis :: $\ce{Anhydride + H2O \ce{->} 2\times Carb. acid}$

How does acid anhydride reactiveness compare to acid chlorides? :: They tend to be less reactive

.....-molar-mass anhydrides react well with water :: Low-molar-mass
How many carboxylic acids does an acid anhydride hydrolysis produce? :: Two (splits it in half and takes the water's oxygen)

![[Reactions of carboxylic acids - acid anhydrides.png]]
##### [[Esters]]
Formula for ester hydrolysis :: $\ce{Ester + H2O <=>T[H^{+}] Carb. acid + Alcohol }$
![[Reactions of carboxylic acids - Ester hydrolysis.png]]

Are esters hydrolysed rapidly? :: No, they hydrolyse slow
Does anything speed up ester hydrolysis? :: Heat with an aqueous acid/base

What is the purpose of the acid catalyst ($\ce{H+}$) in ester hydrolysis? :: The ester's carbonyl carbon becomes more susceptible to water

Name for hydrolysis with a hot aqueous base :: Saponification

##### [[Amides]]
Highly detailed info found at [*Amide hydrolysis* - MasterOrganicChemistry](https://www.masterorganicchemistry.com/2019/10/07/amide-hydrolysis/)

Formula for acidic amide hydrolysis :: $\ce{Amide + HA ->T[H_{2}O][Heat] Carb. acid + Amine}$

Formula for basic amide hydrolysis :: $\ce{Amide + Base ->T[H_{2}O][Heat] Carb. acid + Amine}$

![[Reactions of carboxylic acids - amides.png]]

Can amides be hydrolysed in bases and acids? :: Yes.

Amide reaction speed is typically slow as it is a complex procedure - it has 6 steps 

Are amide reactions fast or slow? :: Basic reactions are very slow, requiring high temperatures for extended periods. Acids still aren't easy.
