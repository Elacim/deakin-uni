[[Functional groups - Carboxyl.png]]
What are the Carboxyl R-group(s)? :: Carbon or hydrogen
Where is the $R-C(O)-OH$ group always positioned in a molecule? :: At the end of a carbon chain

Carboxylic acids may also be called *acetic acid*. An acetate is simply a carboxylic acid but with the $\ce{H}$ being an $\ce{R}$-group.

What are the 3 ways of writing a carboxyl group?
?
- $\ce{R-C(=O)-OH}$
- $\ce{-COOH}$
- $\ce{CO2H}$

Aliphatic carboxylic acid formula :: $\ce{RCOOH}$
Aromatic carboxylic acid formula :: $\ce{ArCOOH}$ (not to be confused with $\ce{Argon}$)

Four carboxylic acid derivatives
?
- [[Acid (acyl) halides]]: $\ce{+H-Cl and -H2O}$
- [[Acid (acyl) anhydrides]]: $\ce{+Carboxyl and -H2O}$
- [[Amides]]: $\ce{+H-NH2 and -H2O}$
- [[Esters]]: $\ce{+H-OR' and -H2O}$

What is a common thread for converting a carboxylic acid to any of it's derivatives? :: It always produces a $\ce{H2O}$ molecule
