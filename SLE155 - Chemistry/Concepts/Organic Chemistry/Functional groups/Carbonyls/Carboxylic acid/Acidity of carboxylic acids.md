What is the typical strength of carboxylic acids (and their derivatives)? :: A weak acid

Rough $K_{a}$ range of carboxylic acids :: $1\times10^{-4}..1\times10^{-5}$
Rough $pK_{a}$ range of carboxylic acids :: $1..5$

How does carboxylic acid acidity compare to alcohols? :: They are stronger acids
Why are carboxylic acids stronger acids than alcohols? :: The $-\delta$ between the oxygens is shared, meaning there are more opportunities for electron donation #question Is this why? (see: [[Resonance]])

#### Reactions with bases
How do carboxylic acids react with weak bases? :: They neutralise each other
How do carboxylic acids react with strong bases? :: They form water-soluble salts

Here, the $\ce{NaOH}$ loses it's $\ce{Na}$ to the `benzoic acid`, replacing the $\ce{H}$. It then loses it's $\ce{OH}$ to form a $\ce{H2O}$ with the `benzoic acid` $\ce{H}$
