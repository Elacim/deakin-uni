What functional groups are readily oxidised into carboxylic acids? :: Aldehydes and primary alcohols

#### Oxidation of aldehydes and primary alcohols
The reactant receives an oxygen on it's $\ce{H}$ to form $\ce{OH}$

Aldehydes can also react with chromic acid ($\ce{Cr(-OH)2(=O)2}$) to form a carboxylic acid.
