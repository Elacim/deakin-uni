Do amines have a high boiling point? :: They vary significantly but tend to be lower than alcohols and greater than alkyls

Are all amines soluble in water? :: They tend to be at least slightly soluble but great compound sizes would affect this

How would an amine with a large, nonpolar group affect solubility? :: It would just about prevent solubility

Amines tend to smell like ammonia. Increased sizes make it smell more of rot.
