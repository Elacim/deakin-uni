**Aniline** :: A benzene with a $\ce{NH2}$ group attached
**Aliphatic** amine :: An amine where $N$ is bonded only to alkyl groups which *may* be bonded to a benzene ring
**Aromatic** amine :: An amine where $N$ is bonded to aryl groups (the benzene ring)
**Heterocyclic** amine :: A benzene ring where a $N$ replaces a $C$
