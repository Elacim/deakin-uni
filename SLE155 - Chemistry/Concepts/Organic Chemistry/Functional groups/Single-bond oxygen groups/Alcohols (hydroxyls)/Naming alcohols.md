###### Common names
Common name for `ethanol`:: `ethyl alcohol`
Common name for `propan-1-ol` :: `propyl alcohol`
Common name for `propan-2-ol` :: `isopropyl alcohol` (no sense to this name, it should really be `sec-propyl alcohol`)
Common name for `butan-1-ol` :: `butyl alcohol`
Common name for `butan-2-ol` :: `sec-butyl alcohol`
Common name for `2-methylpropan-1-ol` :: `isobutyl alcohol`
Common name for `2-methylpropan-2-ol` :: `tert-butyl alcohol` ``
Common name for `cyclohexanol` :: `cycohexyl alcohol`


- Only count the carbon that immediately is after the hydroxyl group
- If the alcohol is on 1, don't mention it (i.e. don't use *iso*)
- If it has branches, count those carbons too for the suffix name
- See: [[#sec-butyl example]]

##### Finding the common (alt-IUPAC) name
###### sec-butyl example
`sec-butyl alcohol` to IUPAC
- `-butyl` indicates that there are 4 total carbons
- `sec-` indicates the carbon has 2 carbon bonds and that the alcohol is on this carbon
- As the `sec-` has two bonds, we can assume that it is in the centre.
- From this, we can determine that the main chain must be the 4 carbons (`-butyl)` and that the second/third carbon must have the alcohol
	- `butan-2-ol`

###### Other
1. `2-methylpropan-2-ol` -> `tert-butyl alcohol`
1. Obtain the name of the alkyl group attached to the alcohol
	1. e.g. `2-methyl-propane`
2. Name the carbon atom as *sec, iso, tert* (primary/secondary/tertiary)
	1. e.g. `tert`
3. Find the number of carbon atoms in the total molecule
	1. `methyl = 1, propane = 3 -> 4`. There are 4 carbon atoms in a `-butyl` group, so we append it to step 2.
		1. e.g. `tert-butyl`
4. Add alcohol to the end
	1. e.g. `tert-butyl alcohol`
