Acidity of alcohols compared to water :: They tend to be weaker acids than water
	Water's pKa is 15.7
		Methanol's is 15.5
		Ethanol's is 15.9
		Propan-2-ol's is 17.0

Think more carbons = less acidic

How would a large molar mass (>ethanol) affect a water-soluble alcohols acidity? :: It would show as a slightly weaker acid than water

Phenols, benzene rings with an $\ce{-OH}$ group, are more acidic than regular alcohols

#### Conversion to haloalkanes
**Note:** We don't need to know past knowing the reactions occurring

What occurs in an alcohol-based [[Halogenation]] reaction? :: The $\ce{-OH}$ group is substituted for the halogen

How do alcohols and haloalkanes differ in solubility? :: Alcohols generally are soluble while haloalkanes usually aren't

What types of molecules are used most for tertiary alcohol reactions? :: Hydrohalic acids

What molecules are commonly used for secondary/primary alcohols? :: Thionyl chloride (most common) and phosphorus halides

##### Hydrohalic acids
What are the hydrohalic acids? :: $\ce{HCl, HBr, \& HI}$, not usually $\ce{HI}$ though
What are the most commonly reacted hydrohalic acids? :: $\ce{HCl \& HBr}$

What is a requirement for the $\ce{C}$ attached to the $\ce{-OH}$ in the alcohol reactant for a halogenation reaction to occur? :: It must be saturated

What alcohol level (primary/sec/tert) is fastest to react? :: Tertiary alcohols
![[Acidity of alcohols - Haloalkane - Tertiary alcohol.png]]
Water-soluble secondary alcohols need a catalyst (in this case an ether) to allow the reaction to occur 
![[Acidity of alcohols - Haloalkane - Secondary alcohol.png]]
Water-insoluble primary/secondary alcohols react slowly

##### Thionyl chloride
$\ce{SO2 \& HCl}$ are gas by-products
Why would an organic base be added to a thionyl chloride reaction? :: It neutralises the $\ce{HCl}$ gas
![[Acidity of alcohols - Alkanes - Thionyl chloride example.png]]

##### Phosphorus halides
Formulas :: $\ce{PX5/PX3}$, where $\ce{X}$ is $\ce{Cl/Br}$
What are these types of reactions best used to form? :: Alkyl bromides
Is it easy to separate the by-products of these reactions? :: Yes as they are water soluble and haloalkanes (usually) aren't
![[Acidity of alcohols - Haloalkanes - Phosphorus halide example.png]]

#### Active metals (groups 1/2)
What do alcohols form when reacted with an active metal? :: They form hydrogen gas ($\ce{H2}$) and metal alkoxides

What part of alcohols reacts with the active metal? :: The $\ce{OH}$ group swapping the $\ce{H}$ for the active metal

What are alkoxides? :: Conjugate bases of alcohol with an [[Organyl|organyl]] $\ce{R}$-group 
What is an alkoxide ion formula? :: $\ce{R-O-}$
What are alkoxide ions good at? :: Donating electrons (it is a good nucleophile)

Naming metal alkoxides
?
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Cation</mark>, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">anion</mark>, then *<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">-oxide</mark>*
**Cation**: simply the name of the cation.
**Anion**: the number + arrangement of carbon atoms (*meth-, eth-, isoprop-, tert-but-*).
e.g. *<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">sodium</mark> <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">meth</mark><mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">oxide</mark>*

Naming alkoxides/alkonolates
?
<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Alcohol</mark> then <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">-ate</mark>
e.g. <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">ethanol</mark><mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">ate</mark>


#### Acid-base questions
Can alcohols act as exclusively bases? :: No, they can be weak bases or weak acids, condition-dependent

Since alcohols are mostly basic, do alcohols mostly only act as bases? :: Not necessarily as the conditions the alcohol is in (e.g. paired with a weaker base) changes the results. It would act as a base if paired with a stronger acid.


Ethanol is the acid, water is the base
The ethanol is donating it's hydrogen to the water and the water accepting it to form a $\ce{H3O+}$ ion
![[Acidity of alcohols - Ethanol + water acid reaction.png]]

The ethanol is the base, and hydronium ion the acid.
The $\ce{O}$ of the ethanol acts as a base when a strong acid is present.
