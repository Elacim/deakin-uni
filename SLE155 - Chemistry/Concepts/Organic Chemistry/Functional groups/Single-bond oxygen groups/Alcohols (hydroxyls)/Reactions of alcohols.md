##### Oxidisation with $\ce{K2CrO3}$ (acid)
Oxidised alcohol with $\ce{K2CrO3}$ can turn into a prim/sec/tert alcohol

Prim alcohol: Aldehyde
Sec alcohol: Ketone
Tert alcohol: No reaction

Aldehyde: Carboxylic acid

##### Dehydration with heat and conc. $\ce{H2SO4}$
Possible acids :: $\ce{H2SO4/TsOH/H3PO4}$
Excess alcohol? ::  At 140$\degree$C, an ether is produced
Excess sulfuric acid? :: At 180$\degree$C an alkene is produced

Process
?
1. $\ce{-OH}$ group gains a hydrogen from $\ce{H2SO4}$, written like $\ce{H-O-SO3H}$
2. The $\ce{-OH}$ group is now a $\ce{H2O}$ and readily leaves the molecule
3. The molecule forms a double bond, usually with a $\ce{C=C}$, to compensate for the lost $\ce{-OH}$

Tertiary/secondary alcohol with a strong acid/base :: Carbocation then elimination reaction for alkene
Primary alcohol with a strong acid/base :: Symmetrical ether then elimination for alkene
