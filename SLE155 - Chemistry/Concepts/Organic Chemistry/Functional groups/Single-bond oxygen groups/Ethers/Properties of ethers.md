#### Solubility and boiling point
Are ethers soluble in water? :: Yes - they form hydrogen bonds with the water
Are ethers similarly soluble in water to similar-mass hydrocarbons? :: No, they are more soluble
How do ether boiling points compare to similar-mass alcohols? :: They are lower

###### Questions
How would the solubility and boiling point of `butane` be compared to `methoxyethane`? :: `butane` would have a lower boiling point and lower solubility

How would the solubility and boiling point of `methoxyethane` be compared to `1-propanol`? :: `methoxyethane` would have a lower boiling point and lower solubility

How would the solubility and boiling point of `1-propanol` be compared to `butane`? :: `1-propanol` would have a greater boiling point and greater solubility
