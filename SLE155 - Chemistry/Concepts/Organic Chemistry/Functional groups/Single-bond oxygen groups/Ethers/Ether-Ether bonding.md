- [[Ethers]] 


Are ether-ether bonds strong? :: No.
What affects ether-ether bonding? :: $\ce{CH3-O}$ having weak dipole-dipole interactions and [[Steric effects#Steric hindrance|steric hindrance]] 
Do ethers have dipole-dipole interactions with other ethers? :: Yes, but only very weakly due to their carbons having all 4 bonds; $\ce{OCH3-O}$ (though full, the carbon is still slightly electropositve)
