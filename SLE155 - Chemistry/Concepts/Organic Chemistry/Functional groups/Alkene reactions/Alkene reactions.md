- [[Markovnikov's rule]] 

1. Substitution
	1. e.g. Halogenation
2. Addition
	1. Only single/double bonded molecules can undergo addition
	2. A product takes it's components and adds it to the co-reactant
3. Elimination
	1. Groups/atoms are removed
		1. e.g. dehydration can remove separate $H$ and $OH$ from a molecule to form $H_{2}O$

Electrophilic addition reactions
Hydrohalogenation - adding $HCl$, $HBr$, or $HI$ to an alkene
Obeys Markovnikov's rule
Hydrogen is added to the carbon with the most hydrogens for the sake of stability carbocation intermediate
90% major product, 10% minor
