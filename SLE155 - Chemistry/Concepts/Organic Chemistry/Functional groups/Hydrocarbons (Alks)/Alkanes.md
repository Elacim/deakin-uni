What is an alkane? :: A saturated hydrocarbon, 
What is an alkyl group? :: An alkane (like methane, $CH_{4}$) missing **one** hydrogen ($\rightarrow$ methyl, $CH_{3}$)
What group is methyl a part of? :: It is a part of the alkyl groups

[[SLE155 - Chemistry for the Professional Sciences/Week 6 - Organic Chemistry - I - Hydrocarbons/Week 6 - Notes#Alkanes|Week 6 - Notes: Alkanes]]
Alkanes: ane, double bond
	Non-polar w/ weak dispersion forces between molecules
	Alkanes w/ $1..4C$ atoms are gases
		$5..17C$: liquids
		$\geq 18$: waxy solids
	Density for $1..10C = 0.7g/mL$
	Isometric alkanes may have different physical properties
		Branched will have lower boiling points than straight chains
			More surface area (like in pentane vs 2,2-dimethylpentane) will have a higher boiling point

Which of $\ce{CH3 CH2 CH2 CH3}$ (butane) or $\ce{ CH3CH2CH2CH(CH3)CH3 }$ (2-methylpentane) has a higher boiling point? :: The 2-methylpentane has a greater surface area

True or false: Alkanes are unsaturated :: False. They are fully saturated.
What is the formula for finding the hydrogen count in alkanes? :: $C_{n}H_{2n+2}$
What is the formula for finding the hydrogen count in cycloalkanes? :: $C_{n}H_{2n}$
