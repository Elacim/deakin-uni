![[IUPAC-example-4.png]]
The triangle is a cyclic structure with a `2,2-dimethyl` and an alcohol. As the alcohol is present and is the highest priority group, the structure is named `cyclopropanol` (instead of `isopropyl bezene`).
At the parent's `3`, we have a benzene ring, which when it is a substituent, is named `phenyl`
A phenyl ring can (and does in this case) have substituents of it's own. The 3rd group is an isopropyl group - `3-isopropyl`. Combined, it is `3-isopropylphenyl`.
The full name combines all these and takes into account the separate numbers:
`2,2-dimethyl-3-(3-isopropylphenyl)-cylcopropanol`

`phen-` suffix meaning :: The species is derived from a benzene

What is the name of this molecule? ![[Cyclic naming - 1-ethyl-2,4-dimethylcyclopentane.png]]
?
`1-ethyl-2,4-dimethylcyclopentane`


What is the name of this molecule? ![[Cyclic naming - question for 6-ethyl-3,3-dimethyl-cyclohexa-1,4-diene.png|200]]
?
`6-ethyl-3,3-dimethyl-cyclohexa-1,4-diene`
![[Cyclic naming - solution - 6-ethyl-3,3-dimethyl-cyclohexa-1,4-diene.png|200]]
Though seemingly counterintuitive, this is because the carbon double bonds (alkenes, 3rd last priority) have a greater priority than the alkyl groups (dead last priority)

The name of this molecule is incorrect, why? ![[Cyclic naming - 3,3-dimethyl cyclohexene.png]]
?
To get the standardised answer, we find the highest priority (the double bond) then aim to get the smallest substituent numbers. We start from the bottom of the $\ce{C=C}$ bond instead of the top to get the answer of `3,3-dimethyl cyclohexene`.

`1-(3-Cyclohexenyl)-1,2-ethanediol`
![[Cyclic naming - 1-(2-Cyclohexen-1-yl)-1,2-ethanediol.png]]
The main carbon chain is as shown above, not the cyclo.
At `1,2`, there are alcohols, so it's `di-ol`. The main chain is an `eth-an-e`, so combined, it's `1,2-ethanediol`.
The cyclo is a branched substituent and has a double-bonded carbon at `3`, so it gains the `-enyl` prefix. It is a cyclo and has 6 carbons so it is `cyclohex`. 
Altogether, it is `1-(3-Cyclohexenyl)-1,2-ethanediol`.

`2-cyclohexyl-ethan-1-ol`
Start at the highest priority group.


What is the name of this molecule? ![[Cyclic naming - 1-cyclyhexylethane-1,2-diol.png]]
?
`1-cyclohexylethane-1,2-diol`
We want the smallest sum of numbers possible. The alternative, `2-cyclohexylethane-1,2-diol` gives us `2+1+2 = 5`, whereas the correct one gives us `1+1+2 = 4`.
