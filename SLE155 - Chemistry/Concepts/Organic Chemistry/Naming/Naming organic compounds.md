Note: Branches are known as substituents

Name branches alphabetically and ignore prefixes when placing things in order
	e.g. `3-ethyl-2,2-dimethylnonane` seems wrong (`e` is after `d`), but ignore the prefix (in this case, `di`) placed on the `methyl` group

You want the longest carbon chain that contains all the double/triple bonded carbons
	`If equal:` Choose the one with:
		 the most branches AND
		 the lowest branch numbers 


 Cyclos:
 Rotate towards highest priority groups
 Priorities:
 1. f
 2. Methyl
