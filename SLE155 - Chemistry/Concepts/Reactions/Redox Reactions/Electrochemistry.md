How to determine the reduction potential of a molecule? :: Look at the reduction table, find the appropriate reaction, and use the number on the side
How to determine the oxidation potential of a molecule? :: Look at the reduction table, find the appropriate reaction, take the number on the side and reverse the sign (i.e. a negative number becomes a positive and vice versa)

Using a reduction table, how can you determine what the species being reduced and species being oxidised is? :: The reduced species will be more positive than the oxidised species

How is reduction potential voltage affected by the stoichiometric coefficient? :: It isn't affected as voltage is an intensive property, meaning it is independent of system size (unlike an extensive property, like mass, which is dependent)


### $E_{cell}$
$E_{\text{cell potential}} = E_{\text{reduction potential, cathode}} - E_{\text{reduction potential, anode}}$ 
Formula for finding the $E_{\text{cell potential}}$  :: $E_{\text{cell potential}} = E_{cathode} - E_{anode}$

What does a negative $E_{\text{cell potential}} = E_{cathode} - E_{anode}$  value mean? :: Reduction does not occur at the cathode (the reaction will not occur)
What does a positive $E_{\text{cell potential}} = E_{cathode} - E_{anode}$ value mean? :: The cathode will be reduced and the anode oxidised (the reaction occurs)

When calculating $E_{cell}$, should any signs be reversed (i.e. negative $V$ to a positive $V$) in any circumstance? :: No 


### Questions
Given $\ce{ 2Ag+ + Zn -> 2Ag + Zn^{2+} }$, what is the cathode, anode, and $E_{cell}$ value?
?
$Ag^{+}$ is being reduced (gaining $e^{-}$) and $Zn$ being oxidised (losing $e^{-}$) 
On the reduction table, $\ce{ Ag+ + e- -> Ag } = 0.80V$ and
$\ce{ Zn^{2+} + 2e- -> Zn } = -0.76V$
Do not reverse the sign on the $Zn =-0.76V$ equation
The silver is therefore the cation and zinc the anion 
$E_{cell} = \text{cation} - \text{anion} \rightarrow E_{\text{cell potential}} = 0.80V - -0.76V = 1.56V$. As the cell potential is positive, the reaction can occur.

Given only $Ni^{2+}$ and $Fe^{2+}$, which species is going to be reduced? What is the suspected equation for it? Is the reaction spontaneous?
?
Looking up the reduction table:
	$\ce{ Ni^{2+} + 2e- -> Ni_{(s)} } = -0.25V$
	$\ce{ Fe^{2+} + 2e- -> Fe_{(s)} } = -0.44V$
The more positive value is the species being reduced, so therefore $Ni^{2+}$ is being reduced (and is therefore the cathode) and $Fe^{2+}$ oxidised (anode). 
The suspected spontaneous equation is:
	$\ce{ Ni^{2+} + Fe_{(s)} -> Ni_{(s)} + Fe^{2+} }$
$E_{cell} = -0.25V - -0.44V = +0.19V$ meaning the reaction is spontaneous and the equation correct
