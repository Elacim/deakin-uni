Don't know an unknown compound?
May know it's a hydrocarbon


**Empirical formula from percentages**
Ethanol: $C=52.14\%$, $H=13.13\%$, and $O=34.73\%$
Treat the percentages as grams (e.g. 52.14% = 52.14 grams)
$\frac{52.14g}{12.011M_{r}}=4.341$ mol of $C$
$\frac{13.13g}{1.0079M_{r}} = 13.026$ mol of $H$ 
$\frac{34.73g}{15.999M_{r}}= 2.171$ mol of $O$ 
Ratio:
	$4.341 : 13.026 : 2.171$
Divide each number in the ratio by the smallest mole count ($2.171$ in this case) 
$\frac{4.341}{2.171} = C_{2}$  (2 moles of carbon per oxygen)
$\frac{13.026}{2.171} = H_{6}$  (6 moles of hydrogen per oxygen)
$\frac{2.171}{2.171} = O_{1}$  (1 mole of oxygen per oxygen - we're treating this is 100% and the rest as higher multiple of it)
The empirical formula is therefore $C_{2}H_{6}O$

Find the percentage with the:
$X\% = \frac{ X \text{ }M_{r} }{ \text{ total M}_{r} }$ -> $\text{ total M}_{r} = \frac{ X \text{ }M_{r} }{ X\% }$
