What do dots represent? :: The non-bonding electrons (which are always valence)
What do lines represent? :: One pair of electrons that is shared between two atoms (so two $e^{-}$)

Downside of formal charges :: They exaggerate the covalent nature of bonding
Downside of oxidation numbers :: They exaggerate the ionic nature of bonding

Put the more electronegative atoms on the outside
- Put the atom that can form the most bonds in the middle, unless you don't
1. Count the valence electrons
2. Assemble to bonding framework using single bonds 
3. Place three non-bonding pairs of electrons on each outer atom except $H$
4. Assign remaining valence electrons to inner atoms
5. Minimise formal charges on all atoms


Electron pair geometry :: The expected shape of a molecule given all bonds and lone pairs (considering them as bond pairs)
Shape vs electron pair geometry :: Actual vs predicted 

#### Determining the central atom(s)
A central atom often does not follow the octet rule
It is the most [[Periodic Table trends and structure#Electronegativity ($ chi$)|electronegative]] ($\chi$) atom
