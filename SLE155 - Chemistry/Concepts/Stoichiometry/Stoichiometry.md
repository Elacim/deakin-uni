$n=\frac{m}{M_{r}}$
- Mass and Molar Mass
$n=CV$
- [[Solutions]] - Concentration and Volume
$n=\frac{PV}{RT}$

1. Need a balanced equation
2. Need molar masses
3. Need a starting point (mass of one or more of a/b/c/d)




$Ba(NO_{3})_{2 (aq)} + Na_{2}SO_{4(aq)} \rightarrow BaSO_{4 (s)} + 2NaNO_{3 (aq)}$
An experiment was begun with 75g of $Ba(NO_{3})_{2}$ and excess of $Na_{2}SO_{4}$. After drying, 64.45g of $BaSO_{4}$ was obtained. What is the theoretical and percentage yield of $BaSO_{4}$?
?
Barium nitrate is the limiting reagent. 
$Ba(NO_{3})_{2} = 261.31g,mol$ -> $n=\frac{75}{261.31}=0.287mol$
$BaSO_{4} = 233.31g,mol$
They are in a 1:1 ratio (moles of $A$ is moles of $B$), so the sulfates' moles are the same as the nitrate ($0.287mol$)
So, the theoretical yield is $0.287mol \times 233.31g,mol = 66.95997$ grams
Actual yield: 64.45g
$\%yield = \frac{64.45g}{66.96}=96.3\%$
