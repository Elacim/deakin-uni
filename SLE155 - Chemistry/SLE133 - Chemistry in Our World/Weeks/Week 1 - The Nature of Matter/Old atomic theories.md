Dalton's Atomic Theory:
	1. Matter consists of atoms
	2. Atoms are indestructible -> they rearrange but don't break apart
	3. In any sample of pure element, all atoms are identical in mass/other properties
	4. Atoms of different elements differ in mass/other properties
	5. When different atoms combine to form a compound, the constituents are always present in the same fixed ratio -> e.g. H2O for water, NaCl for salt etc.
	We didn't know electrons existed at this point.
