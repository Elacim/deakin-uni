The nucleus occupies <0.1% of the total atomic volume
	- Protons (+). # of protons determines element.
	- Neutrons (no charge). Atoms of same element can have varying # of neutrons, these are called isotopes
	- Electrons (-). 1/2000th the mass -> affects chemical properties. They are half-particles (dual wave), they are better represented as a cloud.
Atomic components w/ same charge repel, opposing charges attract
	- Protons repel one another
	- Protons and electrons attract on another
	- Electrons repel one another
	- Neutrons keep the atom just close enough to keep the atom from falling apart  ***???***

There can not be a fraction of an atom and only whole atoms can combine. A 'fraction' of an atom is an explosion or likely something else bad.
