Have the same number of protons (i.e. atomic number), but different number of neutrons
	- Represented by showing it's mass number (A) as a superscript and it's atomic number (Z) as a subscript in front of the atomic symbol -> nuclear symbol.
	- Some exist as a single isotope, most have multiple common (e.g. Iron has 4)
```
A -> mass number
   X -> chemical symbol
Z -> atomic number (# of protons)
```
Regular hydrogen (protium) has one proton (1.008). Deuterium (1P, 1N -> mass of 2). Tritium (1P, 2N -> mass of 3). ${^1{^2}C}$ = Carbon 12. You don't have to bother with the atomic number.

Protons/Electrons/Neutrons in a uranium atom with atomic number 92 and mass number 235
	- 92 protons, 92 electrons *(negligible mass)*, 143 neutrons = 235


136 Barium 2+ -> P=56  N=80  E=54
Mass number - Protons = Neutrons
Electrons = Protons + -(ion count)
