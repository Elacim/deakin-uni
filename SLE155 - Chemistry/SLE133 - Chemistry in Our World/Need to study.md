Energy of light corresponds to? -> freq and wavelength
Energy of light is directly prop to? -> freq.
In the photoelectric effect, which of the following is correct? 
	NOTE: There may be more than one answer.
	a. The energy of electrons decreases linearly with the frequency of light
	b. All metals display different behaviour
	c. Electrons are emitted at all frequencies
	**d. Electrons are only emitted above a threshold frequency**
	
	All metals display the same behaviour with different threshold frequencies
	Electrons are only emitted above a threshold frequency
	The energy of electrons increases linearly with the frequency of light above the threshold
