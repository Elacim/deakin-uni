A compound is found to contain 59.9% carbon, 32.0% oxygen and the remainder hydrogen.
What is the empirical formula of this compound?
?
1. Assume there is 100g of sample, meaning there is $59.9g$ of carbon, $32.0g$ of oxygen, and $8.1g$ of hydrogen
2. Divide by molar masses: $C:\frac{59.9g}{12.011}=4.987$ mol; $O: \frac{32.0g}{15.9994}=2$ mol; and $H: \frac{8.1g}{1.0079}=8.0365$ mol
3. Divide all moles into a ratio by the smallest ($O$ at $2$ mol): $C: \frac{4.987}{2}=2.493545$; $O:\frac{2}{2}=1$; and $H: \frac{8.0365}{2}=4.018=4$
4. Empirical formula: $5CO_{2}H_{8}$

A compound was found to consist of 63.5% silver, 8.2% nitrogen and 28.3% oxygen. What is its empirical formula? 
1. Assuming 100g of sample, there is $63.5g$ of silver, $8.2g$ of nitrogen, and $28.3g$ of oxygen
2. Divide by molar masses. $Ag: \frac{63.5g}{107.9g/mol} = 0.589$ mol, $N: \frac{8.2g}{14.01g/mol}= 0.585$ mol, and $O: \frac{28.3g}{16.0g/mol} = 1.77$ mol
3. Divide all moles in ratio by the smallest $Ag: \frac{0.589}{0.585} = 1$, $N: \frac{0.585}{0.585} = 1$, and $O: \frac{1.77}{0.585} = 3$ This gives the empirical formula: $AgNO_3$

1. First, balance the equation: $C_{3}H_{8} + O_{2} \rightarrow CO_{2} + H_{2}O$ to $C_{3}H_{8} + 5O_{2} \rightarrow 3CO_{2} + 4H_{2}O$
2. Find the limiting reagent - in this case, it's $C_{3}H_{8}$ as Oxygen won't run out
3. Convert $30gC_{3}H_8$ to mol ($\frac{30gC_{3}H_{8}}{1} \times \frac{1molC_{3}H_{8}}{44gC_{3}H_{8}}$)
4. For every 1 $C_{3}H_8$, we get $3CO_{2}$ ($\frac{3CO_{2}}{1C_{3}H_{8}}$). We put $CO_{2}$ up top so when we compile all the equations, the $C_{3}H_{8}$s cancel each other out
5. Find the $CO_{2}$ g/mol ($44gCO_{2}/1CO_{2}$) 
6. $\frac{30gC_{3}H_{8}}{1} \times \frac{1molC_{3}H_{8}}{44gC_{3}H_{8}} \times \frac{3CO_{2}}{1C_{3}H_{8}} \times \frac{44gCO_{2}}{1CO_{2}}$

	2. $\frac{ 30gC_{3}H_{8} \times 3CO_{2} \times 44gCO_{2}} {44gC_{3}H_{8}}=90g$ of $CO_{2}$ (theoretical yield)
7. A percent yield of $\frac{70gCO_{2}}{90gCO_{2}}=77.77\%$

	2. $\frac{1Fe_{3}O_{4}}{3Fe}$ (for every 1 $Fe_{3}O_{4}$, $3Fe$ is needed)
	3. $\times$ these by the g/mol of $Fe_{3}O_{4}$
	4. $\frac{45.2 \times 1}{55.85 \times 3} \times 231.55 = 62.47$ grams
	5. **Q1:** Theoretical yield of $Fe_{3}O_{4}$ is $62.47$ grams
3. Actual yield: 58.1g of $Fe_{3}O_{4}$ 
4. **Q2:** $\%yield = \frac{58.1g}{62.5g}\times 100 = 92.96\%$
5. **Q3:** $62.5g \times 75\% = 46.9gFe_{3}O_{4}$

1. Balance the equation: $6V + 5O_{3} \rightarrow 3V_{2}O_{5}$ ($V_{2}O_{5}=181.88$ g/mol)
2. Since both Vanadium and Ozone are 50 grams each
	5. $\frac{50g}{50.9415M_{r}}=0.9815$ g/mol for Vanadium
		1. $\frac{3V_{2}O_{5}}{6V}=3:6=1:2$
		2. $0.9815M_{r} \times \frac{3}{6} \times 181.88M_{r}=89.26$g of $V_{2}O_{5}$
	7. $\frac{50g}{47.9982M_{r}}=1.04171$ g/mol for Ozone
		1. $3V_{2}O_{5}/5O_{3}=3:5$
		2. $1.04171 \times \frac{3}{5} \times 181.88M_{r}=113.68$g of $V_{2}O_{5}$
	8. As Vanadium has a smaller yield when all 50g reacts compared to Ozone, this means that Vanadium is the limiting reagent in this reaction
		1. Therefore, the theoretical yield of Vanadium Oxide is $89.26$g
3. $\%yield=\frac{65g}{89.26g}=72.821\%$
4. 90% efficiency (if the reaction was otherwise perfect): $89.26g \times 0.9=80.334g$
