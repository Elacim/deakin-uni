[[Boiling and Vapour Pressure]]
Molecules entering/leaving liquid surface

Solvent particles being replaced by solute particles, rate of evaporation decreases 
The top layer of solute/solvent particles of affects the vapour pressure point (a mixed layer prevents the pure solute layer from exiting)

Solutions have lower vapour pressures than pure solvent

Solute particle identity does not matter, only concentration (i.e. amount of particles)
