WEBVTT

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
I can update you the details of this mobile. If if you want to do it.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:16.000
But otherwise I will be making the models for you, and I'll be showing it on the camera

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
I can. You can have a look at that, and then draw the structure.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
So it's more about drawing the structures, identifying the different isomers and things like that.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:35.000
So some of you may not need my help, but all because the questions are all there on the worksheet.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Most, if you will be able to answer those questions without seeing the structures also.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
But for those of you who are not, you know.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Okay. With the okay part. Then I can. I'll show you the structures, too.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Okay, so it's all about, you know, you're working on your own.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Basically. But I've got a molecular model set here which I hope we can see change my video virtual background.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
To. I'm blurred. My background yes, I hope you can see it now.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Yeah, so this is the kick that I would be using it's got all those.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Recall the bowl sticks and bolts in there, as you can see right?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.000
So this is what I'll be using. I'll be making the models with these bolts and sticks, and then I'll be showing it to you.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:39.000
With which you will be able to answer your question.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000
David, sorry to interrupt, but I can't say the option to submit.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:48.000
This is just the light up. I can't say the option to submit the practical

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
I did it now, so should be able to see now.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000
It wasn't. Yeah.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Okay. Thank you. Thank you.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Now for those who are not in this class that are 2 of you who don't know one.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Yeah, don't belong to this class. But yeah, so you can finish it and send it to me by email or something that will be better.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Okay. Rather than adding, You let me see if I can add you in there, and then you can submit.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Otherwise, just finish it off and send it to me before 1230. Okay.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And for others, you should be able to see. Now, can you just refresh and look, have a look at that?

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
I thought I had made it visible with the right date.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Can someone have a look and let me know?

00:07:43.000 --> 00:08:09.000
You still can't see it. Okay, give me a minute.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Yes, I've changed the page and everything, but I didn't make it visible.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:26.000
My back.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Done! Now

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Now what I've put in the chat now is like Link, where you can go and build your own motors if you wish to.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Yes, so that way, you know, you can work at your own case, and I mean, once you build a model, it's a bit of a it's a bit of a working ball.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:46.000
So once you build a model, you will get an idea of how that looks like in 3 dimension

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Okay, so what I've been doing is I'll be going out to the worksheet first.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000
And then we'll look at the question. I'll build the model and show it to you. Okay.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Most of the questions, even without seeing the model, should be able to answer, because you know the theory, part of it

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:32.000
So this is how that movie software looks like. So you can actually put in any element from here into that structure, you can build your own structure can put the bones.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:41.000
You can put the elements in there, and then you see that in 3 dimension in here okay, so that's a mobile.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:51.000
I've already updated that in the model. So if you want, you can just give a try with this link which I've put up here

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Okay. Anyway, I'm going on to the worksheets are you able to see the worksheets?

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
So this is what they have. The discussion question is something which you can work on your own.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Okay, so are the following objects, the molecules chiral or not.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:14.000
So I mean by Kyl, to objects. You've you've got the complete lecture for this.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
So you know what Kiral and Acarl means.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Right? So Carlisle's been the ratio objects which are not superimposable.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Images of each other, and which do not have a plane of symmetry.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
So that's how you know something. Is Kyle right?

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:37.000
That do not have a plan of symmetry, a card or something which has the plane of symmetry

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Alright, so it looks symmetric. It has a plan of symmetry, and they' it's not chiral, so not chiral is what we call as a Kyle

00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:00.000
So you can just quickly work out those 3 questions in question. Number one

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Once you finish that and move on to question too.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Done with. Question number one

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
No more integration. Number 2. What's the difference between us?

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Studio center and a chiral molecule

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.000
So these are things like, you know, you can work out on your own

00:13:34.000 --> 00:14:04.000
I can't give you the answer for these. You've already had the lecture for this, and you know what the difference between studios and general molecules

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
So data center is basically a carbon center where there are 4 different connections onto it, or 4 different atoms.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:50.000
A group of items connected

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:59.000
And kirality is for a molecule, so it could be mainly due to the presence of a studio center.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:07.000
So there's a Cdo center like if there are 4 different groups connected to the carbon center, then normally, it will not have a plan of symmetry.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Alright!

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
All good move to the next one

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
I know most of you might have already answered these questions

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
What's the relationship between a cardinal molecule and enantioma?

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:19.000
So Kyle molecule is again a single molecule which does not have any molecule which does not have a plane of symmetry, or which has a studio center.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Therefore it does not have a plan of symmetry.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:28.000
I guess. But that's for a molecule, enantiomerism is for 2 molecules together.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Okay, so it's a pair of chiral substances.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.000
So it's a pair of chiral molecules which has middle remains.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Relationship between them. So a molecule, which is Cairo with its middle roommate, which is also chiral, makes a pair of enchantments

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Okay, move to the next

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:58.000
So for this one and the right hand box, or a picture of the morally you've constructed, show how it can appear to have one angle of 90.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Okay. And you know it says, do not draw a edge and dash with structure. Okay?

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:10.000
So just asking you to put lines for the bonds just normalize would phone be fine.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Now, as it appears to have 90 degree, we know that.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:20.000
So this is what it is. Okay, as you can see, this is what it is right.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.000
It's just meeting right?

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Right. So you know that the angle for meeting is to drawhedral.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
What's the angle for tetrahedral?

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:48.000
One or 9.5, isn't it? That's the angle for to try he'll see you know that methane is tetrahedral, but it's just asking you a weird question like you know, how would it appear if it was drawn in 90 degrees so you can just put it

00:19:48.000 --> 00:20:18.000
as a 9 to degree at right angles. How that would be like, it's just a viewed question, just to, you know, to just to yeah, to work out your imagination, how it would be like your visualization. Okay.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
And 5 and 6. Also, you can answer it's for you to answer I've only given the answer just now.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:54.000
But yeah, wo woke it out

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
D10, too nice!

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:48.000
So you know the name of the geometry? Right? The name of the jump is, what do you provide? Yeah.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000
Whether it is linear or trigonal, or tetrahedral, or whatever it is.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Okay.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.000
The next one is to build a model of chloro methane

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Natal chloride is a common name. Chloro meeting is a Upc name.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:17.000
So here you have to draw a veget and dash with structure that best illustrates the geometry about the central item in the other box.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:27.000
Draw another picture of the model from a different angle. So one is only given for you.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:37.000
So this is how the wedge and dash, which looks like so, which is a thicker one, and the dashboard is the the one to the one behind.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Okay, so this chlorine is sticking out the out of the plane and the hydrogen that that hydrogen is actually behind the the the plan.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Okay. So when we are representing a three-dimensional molecule on a two-dimensional plan, we need to put them as Regis and dash register, just to make others understand.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:08.000
Those of viewing it, understand that? Well, this atom is not on the plane, but sticking out or below, I mean.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000
So behind the plane

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:24.000
So you can draw the same one here this, and now the 2, now the 2 atoms as like oh, you know you could turn it around.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
How would you draw it? So maybe this hydrogen will come to the front disclosure might go to the back.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:52.000
Okay, so put in a different way here

00:24:52.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Are you able to see me on camera? Or do you want me to stop, share and show you on camera?

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000
No, we can see. Yeah.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:13.000
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, good. Then. So one of the hydrogen's I've replaced with a green color, which is a chlorine. Okay?

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:43.000
So still the geometry remains the same. Everything remains the same, except that one hybrid is replaced by chlorine

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Can answer question 8. Also

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:21.000
Done. Question 9 in the C. History seal are the 3 hydrogen atoms equivalent.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000
So what do you think of these 3 hydrogen items connected to the car?

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000
So what do you mean by equivalent? So do. Which means that, do they have identical and we are men.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:36.000
With respect to the other atoms are just sent to themselves, so it's all to do with the connectivity.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:44.000
Okay, so we know that all the 3 hydrogens are connected to the same carbon.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:56.000
We just can get to the chlorine right? So which means that all the 3 hydrogens are in an equal enrollment, doesn't it?

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Because they're all connected to the same content. So they are all equidistant from the chlorine and affected by chlorine.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:33.000
In the same way. Right? So that's what equilibrium is made

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:17.000
Oh, good move to next one

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000
Now the 2 boxes below draw the vegetin dash which pictures of C.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:27.000
H 2. Brcl different angle of viewpoints.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:39.000
Okay, so just make the model for you. So one more hydrogen is replaced by a bromine

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:45.000
That's what it is. It's the same to tryual structure as you can see right?

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000
A hydrogen. So there are 2 hydrogens.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Now, these 2 are the hydrogen's right, and then you have a glorious, and you have a Roman, hey?

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000
It's the same structure

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000
The same geometry right? But maybe you can keep it like this.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:10.000
Control. So when you keep it like this, right?

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:20.000
You find that, so if you keep it this way, you find that this atom, the Brahmin, and the hydrogen are on the same plane of carbon.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:26.000
But this hydrogen is to the front, and this children is to the is behind.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.000
Okay, so this one way of putting it, then roll it over and brought another way.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:42.000
So now the Bromen. Sorry now, though. Yeah. Now the chlorine and the hydrogen are on the same plane as that of high, that that of carbon.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.000
Okay. So for the Vince on the same plane, you draw the single lines with these 2 bonds.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:53.000
Okay with the clone and with the hydrogen and one hydrogen is to the front.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000
So you put a thick wedge for that, and one that the bromine is behind.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.000
So, therefore you put a dash, which for that

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:17.000
Okay, so draw 2 different new plans.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:47.000
And also answer question 11. So that you can answer only wrong

00:34:42.000 --> 00:35:12.000
Yeah, a question. Well, also, you can answer only wrong. Now we don't want. And now we know what equivalent

00:36:50.000 --> 00:37:19.000
That I'll make see to hit 6

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:26.000
Yep. So that is C, 2 hit 6 right?

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:34.000
You can put any way like you would like this. The 2 Carbons

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:41.000
Alright. So the 2 coins wanted to each other, and there are 3 hydrogens with each carbon

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:56.000
No special thing about the single one is that you can actually rotate it, make any possible structure alright, but they are all equivalent structures, because you can rotate it and bring it back to the same thing, right?

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:05.000
So free rotation is possible about the carbon carbon, single bond

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:15.000
So when you're putting it as a venture dashboard structure, the 2 carbons right, the 2 hydrogen's on the top.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:24.000
They are on the same plan. Those 4 items are on the same line, the hydrogen here is the franchise, the hydrogen.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:31.000
Here is also to the front and the right to 5 regions behind

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:39.000
Okay.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:48.000
Louis structure is how you see this. Okay? So you write the carbon, the single bond between them and the hydrogens, and all that condensed structure is putting this together.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:55.000
One end, together with the carbon, so ch. 3. And then this is together, as one.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000
See h 3. Right. So you just you don't draw.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000
Draw any lines in between you. Just write. Ch. 3. See h.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:33.000
3. That's it. Okay.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:40:10.000
And then it can end so. The remaining questions, too.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:43:04.000
Should be able to. And so 14 and 15

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.000
Done. Move to next

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:08.000
Also write the Epc. Name

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000
And moving on to the next page. So we need to replace one of the hydrogen.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:27.000
's with a chlorine. Okay, I'm going to do that.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000
So that's it right?

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.000
So I have taken away one hydrogen and put a flow in twice. That's the only thing.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:45.000
So one carbon has got 3 hydrogens. The second carbon has got 2 hydrogens and a clover

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:53.000
So this is how it looks like

00:45:53.000 --> 00:46:09.000
Okay.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.000
Now the question is, all the 2 carbons equivalent?

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:20.000
So one carbon has got 3 hydrogens, the other carbon has got 2 hydrogens and a chlorine.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:35.000
Yeah. So you can answer accordingly.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000
You're not asked to draw the model. You're just asked to build the model.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.000
So I've built it for you. Okay, just have to answer these questions.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:55.000
And all the 5 hydrogen items equivalent. Think about it.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000
So there are 5 hydrogens in total, isn't it? So?

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:17.000
These 3 are connected to the same carbon. These 2 are connected to the same carbon, but if the carbons are not equivalent, then think about it, how it's going to be

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:47.000
And also write the Ipc name

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:46.000
Done

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:56.000
Right that you, Casey, name if you rotate the hydrogen atoms to a different position by turning about the central carbon carbon bone to get different structures.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:01.000
Isomer, so I'm going to turn it around for you.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:06.000
Okay. So I'm gonna turn it around. They can actually come back to the same structure.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.000
Alright! There's no change in the structure at all.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:15.000
Yeah, see, that can come back to strain same structure, isn't it?

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:19.000
But do you get a different structure? What do you mean by structuralize them?

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.000
Or a constitutional isomer.

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.000
Optional is summer, or constitutional license.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:36.000
When you have a different connectivity, if the connections are still the same, then it is the same thing

00:51:36.000 --> 00:52:06.000
It's not a different isomer. Okay, yeah.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:41.000
Okay. We'll watch the next month.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:46.000
Build all possible models for dichotomy, ethane

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:49.000
So now we've got 2 chlorines. Okay?

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:54.000
Which means that I have to replace one more hydrogen with another clure.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:02.000
Okay? And what are the different ways? They can do it so that are 2 carbons. There should be 4 hydrogens and 2 chlorine.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:15.000
So what it can do is I can have chlorine been a new chlorine being put on the same carbon as we have the old one.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:23.000
Okay, which is this carbon? Or I can put a chlorine on the all the carbon.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:42.000
Okay. So I'll show you one of that does care

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:43.000
So that is one right? So for the the the first hydrogen is got all the 3 hydride.

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:54.000
So office carbon is what all the 3 hydrogen's in it, and this carbon has got 2 clients and a hydrogen.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:59.000
Okay, so that's one way of putting it right. Another way is check.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:04.000
Go one of the floating from here

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:07.000
And

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:11.000
Put it on that other cop

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:18.000
Right? So that is 2 different connectivity, as you can see.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:26.000
Fine, so you can draw the content structure

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:32.000
Of the 2 Isomers.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:41.000
And also that you pay a nice

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:44.000
Okay.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:55:14.000
So both chlorines on the same carbon and each clothing on different car

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:27.000
The next one c. 4. Hitch 10. Okay. 4 carbons in a row.

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:45.000
Each carbon is tetrahedral. It's got for connections, so the carbon, the first carbon it's got 3 hydrogens, and the fourth board is connected to the second carbon, and that carbon is good 2 hydrogens.

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:52.000
And the bone disconnect to the next carbon, and this carbon has got 2 hydrogens.

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.000
Connect you to the next car, and the last couple and again it's got 3 hydrogens.

00:59:53.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Okay, simple structure.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Can find that all the carbons are having a tetrahedral with a one or 9.5 degree angle, because it's all single-born between the compass

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Okay, so this is one way of doing, say, for hitch 10.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:26.000
What can be another way you can have 3 carbons in a row.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Okay, and then take away that last carbon. Okay, I'm going to take away the last carbon with its hydrogen.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Okay. And then I'm gonna take a hydrogen from the middle carbon here.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:45.000
And I'm going to put that carbon in here so that creates a branch, as you can see.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Alright. So 3 carbons in a row, and then this middle carbon has got a branch with us.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Ch. 3

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:02.000
How would you name this? So it's a 3 carbon with a branched see H.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.000
3 metile connected to the second carbon, so you can name it also, it can draw the schedule structure is just this, okay?

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:15.000
The skeletal structure is this, but with the carbon and hydrogen, and code instructor will be the ch. 3.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Then the ch with the ch. 3, and then I see history alright.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:27.000
So do it. The appropriate answer, the questions, the appropriate way

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
So I've shown you both. Okay, is another structure possible?

01:01:30.000 --> 01:02:00.000
No, that's a maximum branching possible for see? Full

01:04:50.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Sorry.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:17.000
So just to plurality. Now we've been asked to construct a model of meeting, and also model of a small image.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:26.000
So I've done 2 meetings. Basically, okay, right?

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.000
So can. The remaining just basically proposed on the original.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Everything. So if you put on that the pots match so superimposition means, whether the parts match when you put it in one form so like this is how they will just imagine that there is a mirror here.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:52.000
So this is exactly how they will. Sit as my roommates, and just like that if I take one put on top of the other.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000
The parts. Match. Okay? Sorry.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:08.000
The parts match right.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Oh, good Christian, number 26. Does meeting contain a plan of symmetry?

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:24.000
What do you think? Does it test? Apply as much free? Can it be cut across the Adams so the one of the talk, the one behind and the carbon in the middle?

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000
If you cut it all you get to Exact house

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Basically, it's got 4 planes of symmetry

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:43.000
And is it, Chiral? Answer your question.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:08:13.000
So by the time you answer those 3 questions I'll make the next one for you. Okay.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:18.000
So in these questions you don't have to explain. Okay, you just have to say.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Whether yes or no. Well, what is okay? Just yes, sir, no questions.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Now that is plural meeting

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.000
So same story.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:38.000
The parts match, because there is still kind of symmetry.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000
This bacon? Could it just bake and could it?

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:56.000
And feel superimposed, though, on the original. That's what it looks like.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:06.000
So answer. Question 2829, and 30

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Right. Then I would make the next one

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:59.000
So look at this now.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Still has a plan of symmetry. Okay? So cardiac.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Cross the orange, the green, and the common of the black to the center.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Okay, those 2 bones. And the carbon still has a plan of symmetry, because 2 hydrogen's on either side for both of them

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Okay.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Take it. So 31, 32,

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000
And to 33

01:10:39.000 --> 01:11:04.000
I have to put it, Lauren

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
To keep them as my roommates is 4 different things connected.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:11.000
So you you you can imagine how that's going to be like.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:18.000
So I'll try to put them as

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Tip. 2. Replication and brush

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Yeah, so say this.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Okay. I've put them as my roommates imagine.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000
There's there's a mirror here right in the center.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000
So this is how you will see the Mesmer images.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000
But decide on whether they would superimpose or not.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:09.000
So I'm going to keep one on top of the other one and see if the pots match or not.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:15.000
And decide whether it has a plan of symmetry or not.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:45.000
What we can see.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000
That's connected to it.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Chip.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Now let me make this model by the time you've finished other questions

01:13:46.000 --> 01:14:11.000
To all. So there should be 4 carbons

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:18.000
I think it's full callpins. And then on the second car there should be no hitch, right?

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:23.000
So oxygen is this red? Okay? So I'm going to fix on the second carbon, which is this cop. And I'm going to fix.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:35.000
An oxygen. This hydrogen

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Little bit. Oh, oxygen with the hydrogen I can see here.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Alright, so carbon number one, which is this one? Right?

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Carbon number 2 is this one? Want to see? It's call number 2 right?

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:07.000
And that is called an oxygen. That carbon is connected to an oxygen with a hydrogen okay, so it's carbon number 2 with and oxygen.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:14.000
And how is she connected to it? Okay? And then you have good coin number 3 and carbon number 4.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Bye.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:25.000
The rest is that should all be filled with higher hydrogen, which I'm not doing

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:32.000
You know that they're all

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:46.000
So second carbon will have a noh

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Okay, that's what I guess.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Okay? Oh, good. What? We can see it in detail.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:23.000
So this is a second column, and it has got that oxygen and

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Now, when you are drawing the bench and dash rich structure of Butan to all just concentrate on this carbon.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:39.000
So the carbon having the old hitch. Okay? So carbon having the old H.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
What are the connections on that carbon, the carbon has got to?

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:47.000
O. Hitch connected to it a hydrogen connected to it.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:52.000
The whole of this card, which is an ethyl part connected to it, which is the H.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.000
2, ch. 3, okay, and a meet file connected to it. Ch.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000
3. So there's a ch. 3, that is, a ch.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:05.000
2 ch. 3. That is a no hedge and a hydrogen connected to that carbon.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:17.000
So you can just draw that carbon. Put the 4 bonds around it where 2 are single lines, and the other 2 are vegan, which a dash which lines okay?

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:22.000
And then own those 4 of them. You can put them as whole like.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Oh, h hey! See h, 2 c h 3, and see h 3

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:44.000
I don't mind if you draw it this way also, but that will be an easy way to draw it so that it's you'll be able to draw them in image also.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:53.000
So middle roommate should be exactly like a more image of the one you've drawn on the left hand side

01:17:53.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Okay, so draw the left one first, and then, looking at that, draw the mirror image on the right box

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:13.000
If you have good enough in drawing in more view, we can go ahead and then crop and put damage here.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Another way of doing it.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Okay.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:26.000
And the second one there is 2 bromo Butane, so instead of the oh h!

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.000
It is a bromine. That's the only difference.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Okay, a bromin in place of the oakh.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:44.000
So you get a similar kind of I, an original and okay.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Yeah, so, and he's showing that

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Can give you 5 min for that. You will take 5 min to do it.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:25.000
So take your time, and draw every, not disturb you for 5 min

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Johnny.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Who want to. The next

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Okay, so just moving on to the next one to promote.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Attend one. Also, let me just make it. Okay.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:36.000
That's how the molecule looks like it's it can means it is 2 carbons.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Okay, the first carbon is this one. Okay, you just go.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:45.000
And oh, it's connected to it, and 2 hydrogen's.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:50.000
The other carbon escort, a Roman with 2 hydrogens.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:27:13.000
You can also keep it like this, and you can also find line of symmetry

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Okay. You find a studio center. This carbon has got 2 hydrogens.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Now the carbon also has got 2 hydrogens

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:42.000
So now we can draw the structure and see whether you find the studio center or not, and draw the mirror image

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Yes, if you have completed and submitted, you can leave the meeting.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:28:16.000
No problem. I'll modulate it this

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Okay. Well, good.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Lieutenant to all. It's my roommate 2 Brahma Butane, the marimage.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:09.000
And how many students it does a present, just the number of studio centers in each of them.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Okay, that's it.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Question. 42. Okay, let me check it. Just question 420, okay.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:27.000
For the coming questions.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:33.000
The molecules carrier, just comparing the mirror images

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Okay.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:30:05.000
The original and the mirror image

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Move on to the next question.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Build the following molecule. And in my roommate, okay, so let's see, 2 companies

01:32:44.000 --> 01:33:01.000
And it should be to blow right and to province. Okay.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Okay, so that's it. Okay.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:31.000
So how many steel centers are present is a molecule chiral.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Does it contain a plan of symmetry? Can answer all those questions.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:41.000
I'm not going to help you with anything. Okay.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:55.000
You've done so many questions now, so you know exactly what what it is. I'm showing you the different from different angle

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Essentially.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:18.000
As you can say, it's like this.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Okay, kind of draw

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:53.000
