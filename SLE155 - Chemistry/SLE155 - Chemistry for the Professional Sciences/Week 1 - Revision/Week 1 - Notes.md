Molecular mass - mass of a substance's molecules (in the 'u' unit)
Molar mass - g/mol

Avogadro's Number - $6.022 \times 10^{23}$
$H_{2}O \rightarrow H_{2} + O$ ($N_{A} \rightarrow 2N_{A}$)

$3H_{2} + 1N_{2} \rightarrow 2NH_{3}$
$12H_{2} + 4N_{2} \rightarrow 8NH_{3}$
$18.2H_{2} + 6.06N_{2} \rightarrow 12.12NH_{3}$

$3:2$
$12:-$
$\frac{2}{3} \times 12$

Colloidal
Sugar in water - the sugar is transparent because it can 'hide' in the water
Milk - the lactose is not transparent as it's too big to 'hide'
