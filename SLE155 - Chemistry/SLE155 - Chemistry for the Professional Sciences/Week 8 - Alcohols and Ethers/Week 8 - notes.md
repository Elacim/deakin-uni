**Alcohol summary**
True or false: Alcohols are always polar. :: True. The $-OH$ group makes this certain.
How does the boiling point of alcohols change with molar mass? :: The more molar mass, the higher the boiling point
How does the boiling point of an alcohol compare to a similar-mass hydrocarbon? :: The alcohol will have a higher boiling point
How does the solubility of alcohols in water compare to similar-mass hydrocarbons? :: The alcohol is more soluble in water than other hydrocarbons
$pK_{a}$ range of alcohols and what this indicates :: They have a range of $16..18$ which means they are a very weak acid (weak base)

**Phenols**
What is a phenol? :: A benzene ring with an $-OH$ group attached to one of the benzene's carbons
What is the general pH of phenols and their derivatives? :: They are all weak acids, so $4..<7$
What is the rough $pK_{a}$ of all phenols? What does this indicate? :: $\approx 10.0$, meaning they are weak acids


[[Flammability]]
Viscosity describes a liquid's resistance to flow. A viscous liquid does not flow easily. A non-viscous liquid does flow easily.


**Dehydration - Slide 12b**
- alcohol heated with acid catalyst
- OH group is lost, and a H is stolen from an adjacent carbon atom
	- This produces an alkene as the carbons must double bond to achieve stability
		- The most stable alkene isomer is the major product, chosen by the $\ce{C=C}$ bond with the most substituents
- opposite to hydration (water to alkene)
	- hydration is electrophilic addition 
- follows Zaitsev's rule (chapter 18, $\beta$-elimination)
![[Alcohols - dehydration major and minor product.png]]
Primary alcohols = hardest to dehydrate
Tertiary = easiest

**Oxidation**
Primary alcohol being oxidised $\ce{->T[Oxidise]}$ aldehyde (sec-alcohol) $\ce{->T[oxidise]}$ carboxyl
Secondary alcohols $\ce{->}$ ketones
Tertiary alcohols $\ce{->}$ not easily oxidised
	- The OH is bonded to three carbons meaning if oxidised, there can be no O=C double bond 
	- There are not hydrogens which can easily be replaced
	- think: no hydrogen? resistant to oxidisation.

**Condensation**
Esters are formed by condensing alcohols with
- carboxyls
- acid chlorides
- anhydrides
Slide 14a


**Phenols**
[[Aromatics (Arenes)]] 
Phenol = Benzene with a hydroxy group
Solids, low melting points, slightly soluble in water, much more acidic than alcohols
- Acidity
	- Phenols $pKa \approx 10$
	- Alcohols $\approx 16$

![[Phenols - kekule destabilisation.png]]Substituents that take aromatic ring $e^{-}$s increase the molecule's acidity, as demonstrated in this table
![[Phenol - acidity chart.png|200]]
This difference in acidity allows separation of water-soluble alcohols and phenols.
How would a mixture of `cyclohexanol` and `4-methylphenol` be separated? :: Dissolving them in an ether like `diethyl ether` then mixing it with a base like $\ce{NaOH}$ separates them into an ether layer (the hexanol) and a water/aqueous layer with the phenol (**Week8/Slide 16b for more complete rundown**)
