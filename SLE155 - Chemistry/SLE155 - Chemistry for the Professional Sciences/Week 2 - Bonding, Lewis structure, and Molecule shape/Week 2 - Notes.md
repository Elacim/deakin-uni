Why can two electrons exist in a single orbital? :: They can as one will have $+\frac{1}{2}$ and the other with $- \frac{1}{2}$

The lone electron at the end of the 3p5 chlorine bond happily connects to another electron
	Sigma bond

Nitrogen, Oxygen, Hydrogen, Fluorine, Chlorine, Bromine, and Iodine exist as diatomic

Subshells (s, p, d etc.)
p: $p_{x}, p_{y}, p_{z}$


What is the Chlorine-Chlorine covalent bond an example of? :: A sigma bond

[[Chemical species]]

What is the octet rule? :: The tendency for atoms to gain electrons up until 8 electrons in their outermost shell
In terms of the octet rule, which element in the second row is an exception? :: Boron. The electron configuration of the ground state has $2p^{1}$. In the excited, one of the $2s^{2}$ electron goes up to the $2p$ level, forming $2p^{2}$ (↑-↑---). Now, there are 3 unpaired electrons, meaning the atom can form three bonds 

What is the rule for the number of bonds an atom can form? :: Unpaired electrons 

Boron
$1s^{2}2s^{2}1p^{1}$

When using a single, double, or triple line to represent a bond, why type of bond is this? :: A covalent bond

What is a coordinate covalent bond? :: A bond where one atom donates both electrons (a filled orbital to a vacant orbital) instead of sharing a half-filled to another half-filled
What is the bond name if a filled orbital donates two electrons to another atom's vacant orbital? :: A coordinate covalent bond


What causes dispersion forces? :: The temporary polarisation of electrons

$(H-F)-(H-F)$
Each fluorine has 6 lone electron pairs and is negatively charged

Which phase has the weakest intermolecular forces? :: Gases
Which phase has the strongest intermolecular forces? :: Molecular solids


Lattice energy :: The energy needed (kj mol$^{-1}$) to break an ionic lattice apart
What does lattice energy depend on? :: The ion size and charge
What is the effect of size on lattice energy? :: Increased cation or size means a decrease


### Lewis structures
What do dots represent? :: The non-bonding electrons (which are always valence)
What do lines represent? :: One pair of electrons that is shared between two atoms (so two $e^{-}$)

1. Count the valence electrons
2. Assemble to bonding framework using single bonds 
3. Place three non-bonding pairs of electrons on each outer atom except $H$
4. Assign remaining valence electrons to inner atoms
5. Minimise formal charges on all atoms

How many valence electrons are available in a Phosphorus atom? :: 5
How many valence electrons are available in a Chlorine atom? :: 7
How many electrons are in play for $PCl_{3}$? :: $P=5$ and $Cl_{3}=7 \times 3 = 21$ -> $5 + 21 = 26e^{-}$
![[PCl_3.png|100]]

How many electrons are in play for $SO_{2}$? :: $S=6$ and $O_{2} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \rightarrow 6 + 12 = 18e^{-}$

Lone pair count formula :: $\frac{ Ve^{-} - 8n }{2}$  ($Ve^{-}$ is the total number of valence electrons of all atoms, and $n$ is the amount of atoms in the molecule but minus 1)

Homework: Try doing the $PO_{4}^{3-}$ Lewis diagram and all it's resonance structures

Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory

[[Periodic Table trends and structure#Electronegativity ($ chi$)|Electronegativity trends]]

What is electronegativity? :: An atom's attraction to electrons
What is the most electronegative atom and what is it's value? :: Fluorine with an electronegativity of 4
