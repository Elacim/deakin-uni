substituent

5 -> 1
Methyl on the 3rd $C$
`3-methylpentan-2-ol`

```smiles
CC(C)C(O)CC
```
Number from end closer to double/triple bond
Actual functional groups have higher priority

Add groups based on alphabetical order (e.g. chloro before methyl; ethyl before fluoride)

Alkanes: $C_{n}H_{2n+2}$
Cycloalkanes: $C_{n}H_{2n}$

Single bonds can rotate wherever
Double bonds have a rotational restriction (think an elastic connection)
	Due to pi-sigma overlap

Cis-trans isomerism in cycloalkanes: Arrangement of the atoms in space that cannot being changed by rotation around sigma bonds
Cyclohexanes are common in nature
The most stable configuration is the chair conformation, and second most the boat (which leads to H-H clashes, known as a steric strain. Week 6 slide 30b)



### E, Z system
E, Z system fixes the trans/cis problem by assigning a priority to the atoms/groups in.
Priority is determined by the number on the periodic table (high = high priority).
E (entgegen)
Z (zusammen)
The Z configuration is used if the higher priority groups are on the same side
and the E configuration if the high priority groups are on the opposite

What atom should be selected  for a hydroxyl group  


Alkadienes: 2 $C$ bonds
Alkatrienes: 3 $C$ bonds
Polyenes: $> 3C$
$n$ number of $\ce{C=C}$ bonds has a maximum of $2^{n}$ cis-trans isomers possible

Alkenes/ynes are:
	non-polar compounds
	have only dispersion forces
	similar properties to alkanes

Alkanes aren't that reactive due to strong carbon-carbon bonds
$\text{alkane} + O_2 \rightarrow  CO_{2} + H_{2}O + \text{ energy}$

Halogenation (substitution reaction)
	When $\geq 1 H$ atoms are replaced by a halogen
	Requires heat/light
	Mixture results but product is written as monosubstituted
	$CH_{3}CH_{3(g)} + Cl_{2(g)} \xrightarrow{light} CH_{3}CH_{2}Cl_{(g)} + HCl_{(g)}$
1. Substitution
	1. e.g. Halogenation
2. Addition
	1. Only single/double bonded molecules can undergo addition
	2. A product takes it's components and adds it to the co-reactant
3. Elimination
	1. Groups/atoms are removed
		1. e.g. dehydration can remove separate $H$ and $OH$ from a molecule to form $H_{2}O$ 

Reagant is something that acts on the reactant to form the product
Nucleophile :: An $e^{-}$ rich reagent (like $OH^{-}$) that can donate $e^{-}$ pairs to other species in a reaction
Electrophile :: An $e^{-}$ poor reagent (like $H^{+}$) that can accept $e^{-}$ pairs from other species in a reaction
Radical :: A species containing an odd number of $e^{-}$


# Class 2

Electrophilic addition reactions
Hydrohalogenation - adding $HCl$, $HBr$, or $HI$ to an alkene
Obeys Markovnikov's rule
Hydrogen is added to the carbon with the most hydrogens for the sake of stability carbocation intermediate
90% major product, 10% minor
Major:
```smiles
CC(Cl)CC
```

Minor:
```smiles
CCC(Cl)C
```

Arenes are highly unsaturated ($1C:1H$)
Benzenes do not undergo addition, oxidation, or reduction and instead react by substitution
Every pharmecuetical drug has a benzene structure in it - because it allows substitution, drugs that have effects due to different atoms in place of $C$s can be made
Kekule's model of benzene (came to him in a dream - a snake biting it's own tail)
![[Kekule's model of Benzene.png|250]]
Benzene can bond anywhichway (diagonally, left, right etc.)

![[Aromatic benzene hybridisation.png|250]]
Carbon with two bonds is `sp2`
