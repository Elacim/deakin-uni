$K_{c} = \frac{0.00500}{0.0420 \times 0.0240} = 4.9603$

If $BrCl$ initial concentration is 0.050 mol, what is the $K_{c}$ for $Br_{2}$ and $Cl_{2}$?

| Concentration | BrCl     | Br_2 | Cl_2 |
| ------------- | -------- | ---- | ---- |
| Initial       | 0.050    | 0    | 0    |
| Change        | -2x      | +x   | +x   |

If 0.100 mol of $CO$ and 0.100 mol of $H_{2}O$(g) are placed in a 1.00-litre reaction vessel at this temperature, what are the concentrations of the reactants and products when the system reaches equilibrium?

| Concentration | $CO$                         | $H_{2}O$ | $CO_{2}$ | $H_{2}$ |

| Equilibrium   | $0.1M-x$                     | $0.1M-x$ | $0M+x$   | $0M+x$        |

$K_{c} = \frac{ [H_{2}] [CO_{2}] }{ [CO] [H_{2}O] }$
$4.06 = \frac{ [H_{2}] [CO_{2}] }{ [CO] [H_{2}O] }$
	> $4.06 = \frac{ x \times x }{ (0.1-x)(0.1-x) }$
	> $\frac{ x^{2} }{ (0.1-x)^{2} }$
	> $\sqrt{4.06} = \sqrt{ \frac{ x^{2} }{ (0.1-x)^{2} } }$

| Change        | $-0.0668$                    | $-0.0668$              | $0.0668$ | $-0.0668$ |
| Equilibrium   | $0.1M-0.0668 = 0.0332M$      | $0.1M-0.0668 = 0.0332M$ | $0.0668$ | 0.0668    |

Check this:
$K_{c} = \frac{ [H_{2}] [CO_{2}] }{ [CO] [H_{2}O] }$
$K_{c} = \frac{ 0.0668 \times 0.0668 }{ 0.1668 \times 0.1668 } = 4.097 = 4.1$

| Concentration     | $2H_{2}SO$           | $2H_{2}$ | $O_{2}$ |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| Initial ($M$)     | $\frac{0.015}{5.00L}=0.003M$ | $0$      | $0$     |

| Equilibrium ($M$) | $0.003M-2x$          | $2x$     | $x$        |

$6.0 \times 10^{-28} = \frac{ (2x \times x) ^{2}}{ (0.003M -2x)^{2} }$
1. As $K_{c}$ is so low, the denominator $x$ can be assumed as extremely small compared to the other, known values ($2x <<<< 0.003$) and therefore it can presumed that $0.003M-2x$ is equal to = $0.003M$
2. $6.0 \times 10^{-28} = \frac{ (2x)^{2} \times x}{ 0.003M^{2} }$
3. $6.0 \times 10^{-28} = \frac{ 4 \times x^{3} }{ 9.0 \times 10^{-6} }$
4. $6.0 \times 10^{-28} \times 9.0 \times 10^{-6} = 4 \times x^{3}$
5. $\frac{6.0 \times 10^{-28} \times 9.0 \times 10^{-6}}{ 4 } = x^{3}$
6. $\sqrt[3]{ 1.33 \times 10^{-33} } = x$

At equilibrium, these concentrations for this reaction were found: $N_{2}$ (0.15M) + $Cl_{2}$ (0.25M) $\rightarrow NCl_{3}$ (0.50M). What is the equilibrium constant?
?
First, balance the equation:
	$N_{2} + Cl_{2} \leftrightharpoons NCl_{3}$ balances as $N_{2} + 3Cl_{2} \leftrightharpoons 2NCl_{3}$
Setup the equilibrium constant equation, $K_{c}$: 
	$\ce{ K_{c} = \frac{[NCl3]^{2} }{ [N2] [Cl2]^{3} } }$ 
Plug in the values and calculate:
	$\frac{ 0.50M^{2} }{ 0.15M \times 0.25M^{3} } = 106.67$
