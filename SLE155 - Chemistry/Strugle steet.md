##### Must knows
Acid-base stuff - [[Acidity of alcohols]] 
- Find $K_{a}/pK_{a}$ of functional groups

[[Electrochemistry]] 

[[Solutions]] 

[[Boiling and Vapour Pressure]] - vapour pressure video 

# LOOK AT DINOSAUR NOTEBOOK

##### Refresher needed
[[R and S configuration]] 

What effects [[Polarity]] 

##### Unsure if we need to know
[[Hybridisation]] (more info in here)

[[SN1 reactions]] 

[[Reactions of alcohols#Dehydration with heat and conc. $ ce{H2SO4}$]]
Major product of `3-methylbutan-2-ol` is apparently not `3-methylbut-1-ene`
