In lectures we discuss topics including cell biology and diversity, genetics, molecular biology and how these influence our latest thinking about evolution. We also dip our toes into a little plant biology and cell growth and division to show how cells cooperate in an organism. Lecture material and relevant questions will be presented in advance on the LMS site for students to work through, and workshops will be used to explain the more difficult concepts and for interactive problem solving. The practical component focuses on biological observation, laboratory skills and data interpretation, and introduces a number of biological disciplines. BIO1CO is a cornerstone subject, so there is some emphasis on the graduate capabilities, especially creative/critical thinking and communication skills."},

But much of our thinking and reasoning is biased, distorted, and uninformed. This subject trains you to reason well, to think clearly and independently, and also to engage fairly with others in discussions and debates. You will develop useful skills in presenting, analysing and evaluating different types of arguments. You will learn to apply these skills to real cases from popular culture, current affairs, and philosophy. You will also learn to use diagrams and symbols to assist higher and more abstract levels of logical reasoning and systematic thinking. Because the ability to think and to argue clearly and fairly is central not just to philosophy but to university studies in general, many students find the experience gained in this subject immensely valuable, both within the university and later in employment whatever their subsequent areas of specialization."},

In this subject we will explore how structures that have evolved within animals and within plants function to address key challenges that living organisms face.  You will discover the differences between plants and animals in how they capture and distribute energy and nutrients around their bodies and then utilize them for growth and movement.  Other interactions between an organism and its environment that you will learn are how an immobile plant defends itself from predators and how animals regulate their internal temperature.  You will examine plant structures critical for growth and learn of the role of plant growth regulators.  Animal development and animal adaptations for feeding and moving will be explored.  This subject may involve working with live arthropods."},

In this subject students will learn about the chain of infection, immunity and vaccination, disease prevention, and disease surveillance. Selected microorganisms will then be described and compared: the main focus is the natural habitat of the organisms (reservoirs of infection), the ways in which humans can encounter the organisms (routes of infection) and the strategies available at the individual, community and global levels to prevent disease and, in the diseased patient, to cure disease. In parallel, workshops will focus on laboratory techniques that can be used for disease diagnosis including culture-based methods, molecular methods, and immunological approaches.  Workshops will culminate in an infectious disease case study."},

Students are introduced to the basic principles of the scientific, economic and sociological approaches that underpin the current debate. Through a problem-based approach, students develop a recognition and understanding of the causes and impact of climate change and the responses of science, society and business to this. This subject addresses La Trobe's Sustainability Thinking Essential. Sustainability Thinking entails deep appreciation of how our actions and choices affect the natural, economic, social, political and cultural systems-now and in the future."},

In this subject, students study the processes and skills required for interviewing, focussing on key case studies in literature, print journalism, cinema, broadcasting and online. A key component of the subject will be interviews undertaken by students in all or some of the key interview formats, including live discussion, email, pre-recorded audio and written profile pieces. Undertaking this subject will gain a broader appreciation of the art of inquiry and personal interaction and develop greater confidence in everything from one on one communications to public speaking to critical analysis. You will also gain a clear understanding of the use of quotation technique including quote punctuation, in written work and develop an appreciation of key editing issues, both practical and ethical.\n"}
