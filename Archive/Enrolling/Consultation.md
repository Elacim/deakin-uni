**The course I am interested in studying is called:**
Diploma of Science


**Please outline what you would like to discuss at your consultation:**
- Joining mid-year
- Potential alternate travel options that might cut travel time
- Class load (core subjects/electives) - how many days do I come to campus?
- Some electives say they're unavailable as an elective but they show up as an option within the handbook
- How do I study specifically microbiology? The electives seem unrelated.


- Would I be studying microbiology if I did a diploma of science? How do I sign up for that specifically? [[Core vs. Electives]]



Some electives say they aren't available even though they are listed within the diploma of science handbook


#### Is joining mid-year (July 2023) possible for this course?
I saw that it is possible in some parts of the Latrobe site but other parts omitted that information, I assume for this current intake.

#### Are there any alternate travel options that might make it faster to come to Latrobe?
I'm facing a 5 hour travel journey

#### How many days a week - does this depend on electives?
How many days a week would class be on and which of those would be in-person? Does this depend heavily on the electives on those days?


#### Class load (core subjects/electives) - how many days do I come to campus?


#### Some electives say they're unavailable as an elective but they show up as an option within the handbook


#### How do I study specifically microbiology? The electives seem unrelated.
