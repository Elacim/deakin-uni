<!--SR:!2023-09-14,2,248-->

On the periodic table, what are the names for rows and columns? ::: Periods and groups

What is a physical change?::A reversible change in a given thing's physical properties where energy is not absorbed and does not form a new product.

What is a chemical change?::A irreversible change in a given thing's physical and chemical properties where energy is absorbed and a new product is formed.

What is an example of a physical change?
?
- Phase changes (e.g. Water to steam)  
- Evaporation  
- Breaking a glass

What is an example of a chemical change?
?
- Petrol burning -> water, toxic fumes, lots of energy  
- Baking a cake  
- Rusting metal (oxides are formed)  
- Rotting fruit

What are the four (4) states of matter?::Solid, liquid, gas, and plasma

What is the definition of a solid?:: A solid has a definite shape and volume, it cannot be compressed but it can be malleable. The atoms are arranged in a regular pattern and are tight knit. The bonds may be covalent, ionic, or metallic.

What is the definition of a liquid? ::: Definite volume, with a shape that fills a given container, and it cannot be compressed. The atoms are close but not organised. They may be affected by Van Der Waal forces, electrostatic forces, or hydrogen bonds.
 
What is the definition of a gas? ::: Variable volume and shape, expands to fill a container, can be easily compressed. Atoms are far apart from each other and are free to move independently

What is the formula for Kelvin (from Celcius)? :: Kelvin = Celcius + 273.15
What is the formula for Celcius (from Kelvin)? :: Celcius = Kelvin - 273.15

When is a solid a solid, a liquid a liquid, a gas a gas, and plasma a plasma in regards to temperature?
?
Solid: < melting point  
Liquid: >= melting point and < boiling point  
Gas: >= boiling point  
Plasma: Huge voltage difference/extreme temperatures

What is the difference between a cation and anion?
?
Both a cation and anion are an ion but cations have a positive charge (i.e. missing electrons) and anions have a negative charge (i.e. extra electrons).  
Cation = cat = positive  
Anion = an(ti) = negative

What are the two (2) main chemical species stemming from pure substances? :: Elements and compounds

Of the two (2) main chemical species, what are their subsets?
?
Elements:  
- atoms (Neon). A single independent element.  
- molecules (2 Oxygen). 2+ atoms of a single element type bonding.  
Compounds:  
- molecules (H2O - water). 2+ elements bonding.  
- ions (NaCl - salt). 2+ elements ionically bonding

What is a heterogeneous mixture? ::: A non-uniform mixture with regions of differing composition.  For example: Blood, orange juice, oil and water mixture, or salad dressing. (it means 'differing in kind')

What is a homogeneous mixture? ::: A uniform mixture with the same composition throughout it.  
For example: Cordial, brass, soft drink, or blood plasma. (it means 'of the same kind')

What is the definition of a pure substance? ::: A single element or compound, not mixed with any other substance. For example, pure metals, water, salt, gold, and bicarb soda.

Can components of a mixture be separated? :: Yes. They can be physically separated without changing their identities.

What is an element? ::: A substance that cannot be chemically interconverted or broken down into simpler substances and are primary constituents of matter. Distinguished by its proton count.

What is the basic formula for chemical equations? :: A reagent/reactant/substrate react together to -->> Form a product

What is Ionic bonding? ::: \[UPDATE THIS] when atoms transfer electrons

What is Covalent bonding? ::: \[UPDATE THIS] when atoms share one or more pairs of electrons

What is Hydrogen bonding? ::: \[UPDATE THIS] the intermolecular force in which a hydrogen atom that is bonded to a highly electronegative atom is attracted to an unshared pair of electrons of an electronegative atom in a nearby molecule

Van Der Waal forces :: Comprised of the weaker 'London Dispersion' forces and the stronger 'Dipole-Dipole' forces.

London Dispersion forces :: The weaker Van Der Waal forces that happens in temporarily polar molecules

Dipole-Dipole forces :: The stronger Van Der Waal forces that happens in permanently polar molecules

What causes London Dispersion forces? :: 

What is a molecule's polarisability? :: A molecule's tendency 

At what electric charge is a molecule considered to be polar? :: $>=0.5 \delta$ difference. A molecule with $>0$ $\delta$ but less than 0.5 is considered to be non-polar

Dipole moments :: Depends on electric charge ($>=0.5 \delta$) and the distance between electric charges. Dipole moment = Charge \* distance between opposite charges.

. This tends to increase the further 
How does the polarisability of a molecule increase? :: 



In a chemical formula, how do you determine if a chemical/element is in a state of matter?
?
Next to the chemical, in subscript, put the shortened form for the state of matter in parentheses.  
For example:  
- H20(l) -> water in a liquid state  
- CO2(s) - carbon dioxide in a solid state  
- H(p) - hydrogen in a plasma state

What is the Law of Conservation of Mass? ::: No detectable gain or loss of mass can occur in chemical reactions. Mass is conserved.
<!--SR:!2023-09-15,3,268-->

What is the Law of Definite Proportions? ::: A chemical compound always contains exactly the same proportion of elements by mass.
<!--SR:!2023-07-13,1,230-->

What is the Law of Multiple Proportions? ::: When two elements combine with each other to form more than one compound, the weights of one element that combine with a fixed weight of the other are in a ratio of small whole numbers.

What are the charges of protons, neutrons, and electrons (scientific notation in 2 decimal places)?
?

?
Protons: 1.67 \* 10^-27 kg  
Neutrons: 1.67 \* 10^-27 kg  
Electrons: 9.12 \* 10^-27 kg

How do you calculate the average atomic mass of three of the same elements with differing isotopes?
?
We can do this with any element and abundance levels:  
1 - 53.9396u @ 5.80%  
2 - 55.9349u @ 91.72%  
3 - 56.9354u @ 2.20%  
4 - 57.9333u @ 0.28%   
(53.9396 **0.058) + (55.9349** 0.9172) + (56.9354 **0.022) + (57.9333** 0.0028) = 55.84677912u  
Rounded: 55.846u
