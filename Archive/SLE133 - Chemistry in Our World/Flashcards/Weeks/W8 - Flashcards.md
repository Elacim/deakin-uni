## 3 primary intermolecular forces
Three types of intermolecular forces that happen between molecules :: 1. Dispersion forces; 2. Dipolar forces; and 3. Hydrogen bonds
What force is always acting on all substances/particles? :: Dispersion forces

True or False: All hydrogen bonds are polar :: True. A hydrogen bond requires a $H^{+}$ and a highly electronegative atom, meaning the electronegative difference is above the polar threshold.
If there is no polar bond, what must the primary force be? :: Dispersion forces
<!--SR:!2023-08-31,3,263-->
If a molecule is polar and contains no $X-H$ bonds, what is the primary force acting on it?  :: Dipolar (dipole-dipole) forces
<!--SR:!2023-08-31,3,263-->
#### Dispersion forces
Dispersion forces :: The net attractive forces between negatively charged **electron clouds** & positively charged **nuclei** of neighbouring molecules; displayed in all substances
Why do dispersion forces occur? :: The electron cloud of an atom distorts in the direction of an atom's positively charged nucleus; the two electron clouds repel, further distorting the cloud; this distortion creates a charge imbalance
<!--SR:!2023-08-30,2,243-->
What is another name for dispersion forces? :: London dispersion forces (named after the German physicist Fritz London)
<!--SR:!2023-08-31,3,263-->
What do the magnitude of dispersion forces depend on? :: The ease of which the electron cloud of a molecule is distorted, named the polarisability; named an instantaneous dipole
<!--SR:!2023-08-29,1,230-->
Page 386-387: [[Chemistry Core Concepts - Allan Blackman, Daniel Southam, -exclude.pdf#page=386]]
Why would pentane ($C_{5}H_{12}$, $309K$) have a higher boiling point than 2,2-dimethylpropane ($C_{5}H_{12}$, $283K$)? :: Pentane must have a differing shape, likely making the overall polarity higher than within 2,2-dimethylpropane
<!--SR:!2023-08-31,3,250-->

#### Dipolar forces (dipole-dipole)
Dipolar forces :: Also known as Dipole-Dipole forces, molecules with large dipole moment display dipolar forces
<!--SR:!2023-08-31,3,250-->
Why is the boiling point of ethanol ($C-C-O-H$) $376K$ vs. methoxyethane's ($C-C-O-C$) $305K$?

#### Hydrogen bonds
Hydrogen bonds :: A stronger dipole-dipole force that occurs between a $H^{+}$ atom and a highly electronegative atom
What are the three possible atoms that a hydrogen can be bonded with to qualify as a hydrogen bond? :: $H-O; H-F; \text{ and } H-N$
<!--SR:!2023-08-30,2,243-->
What are the two requirements for hydrogen bonds?
?
1. There must be an electron-deficient hydrogen atom ($H^{+}$) that can be attracted to an electron pair, and
2. There must be a small, highly electronegative atom with an electron pair that can interact with the $H^{+}$ atom
<!--SR:!2023-08-29,1,230-->

#### Examples
What is the primary force acting on cyanide ($CN^{-}$)? :: Hydrogen bonding. The negative charge of cyanide readily attracts $H^{+}$.Without a hydrogen, the dipolar forces are the primary actors.
<!--SR:!2023-08-31,3,263-->
What is the primary intermolecular force acting on $CCl_{4}$? :: Dispersion forces. Dipolar forces are also acting on them but due to the tetrahedral structure, all $Cl$ charges cancel each other other
<!--SR:!2023-08-31,3,263-->
What is the primary intermolecular force acting on Ethane ($C_{2}H_{6}$)? :: Dispersion forces. 
What is the primary intermolecular force acting on Ethyl Alcohol ($C_{2}H_{6}O$)? :: Hydrogen bonds. It also has dipolar forces.
What is the primary intermolecular force acting on Ethyl Chloride ($C_{2}H_{5}Cl$)? :: Dipolar forces. It has a polar bond between the $H-Cl$.
<!--SR:!2023-08-31,3,263-->
Is a hydrogen bond a polar bond? :: Yes. It occurs between a $H^{+}$ and a negatively charged atom.

Why does $F_{2}$ have a smaller and less polarisable electron cloud than $I_{2}$? :: $I_{2}$ is a significantly larger molecule which has the effect of allowing more instantaneous dipole moments
<!--SR:!2023-08-30,2,243-->
