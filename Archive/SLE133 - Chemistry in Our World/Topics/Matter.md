Universe is made up of matter and energy
Matter - touch/taste/smell/see - may not be able to due to small quantities
	- Property. A char. for identifying a substance or object (such as size, colour, temp, chem. comp, and chem. reactivity, boiling temp.)
	- Physical change - when from one matter to another in a diff state (e.g. breaking a glass sheet). Phase changes (boiling water -> steam)
		- Water turning into steam is still the same water molecules (H2O(l) -> h2O(g), not H2O -> H2 + O)
	- Chemical change - e.g. petrol burning -> water, toxic fumes, lots of energy

Matter is made up of atoms which are some form of [[Elements]]
