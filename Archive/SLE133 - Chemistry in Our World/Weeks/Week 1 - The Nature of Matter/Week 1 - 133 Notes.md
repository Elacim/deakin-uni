#notes #week-1
Underlines all aspects of life - biology, nuclear chemistry

Scientific method - observation, hypothesise, & exp. to expand body of knowledge
	- Something named after you
	- A theory (relativity, nuclear)

[[Matter]]
Universe is made up of matter and energy
Matter - touch/taste/smell/see - may not be able to due to small quantities
	- Property. A char. for identifying a substance or object (such as size, colour, temp, chem. comp, and chem. reactivity, boiling temp.)
	- Physical change - when from one matter to another in a diff state (e.g. breaking a glass sheet). Phase changes (boiling water -> steam)
		- Water turning into steam is still the same water molecules (H2O(l) -> h2O(g), not H2O -> H2 + O)
		- Evaporation
		- Sawing wood
	- Chemical change - e.g. petrol burning -> water, toxic fumes, lots of energy

Atoms 

Uranium is the largest naturally occurring element. Only 91 is naturally occurring.
Tc (43) is very unstable. 

Molecules - coll. of atoms, definite structure held by covalent bonds (e.g. CO2)
	- Sharing of electrons between neighbouring atoms.
	- Atoms and Molecules are always electrically neutral
		- If not neutral, they are an ion

Ions - pos or neg charge
	Cations are ions w/ + charge (e.g. Na+)
	Anions are ions with a neg charge (e.g. NO3-)
```
An Aluminum (Al) atom loses 3 electrons.
Al -> Al3+, cation
```

Compounds - substances containing two or more elements in definite and unchanging proportion.
Na+ and Cl- are held together by positive and negative charges.

 > + attracts -
	> + repels +
	> - repels -
Are compounds the same as molecules?

Chemical species
	- Elements
		- Atoms
		- Molecules
			- The same element combining 
	- Compounds
		- Molecules
			- Different elements combining
		- Ions

[[States of Matter]]
Solids:
	- Fixed volume and shape
	- Cannot be compressed, can be malleable
	- Atoms arranged in a regular pattern, tight knit
Liquids:
	- Fixed volume
	- Shape changes to fill container
	- Cannot be compressed -> will find a weakness and flow through that
	- Atoms close but not in an organised arrangement
Gasses:
	- Variable volume and shape
	- Expands to fill the container
	- Easily compressed
	- Molecules are far apart, free to move independently

```
Question: Butane has a melting point of -138.4°C and boiling point of -0.5°C.
What is it's state at 25°C?
It would be a gas as it is above the boiling point.
```

Solid:   < melting point
Liquid:  >= melting point and < boiling point
Gas:     > boiling point

[[Hetero and homogeneous mixtures]]
Pure substance:
	- uniform chemical composition (single element or compound)
		- e.g. pure metal, water, salt, gold, bicarb soda
Mixture:
	- blend of two+ substances
		- Homogeneous - uniform mix with the same composition throughout
			- e.g. Cordial, brass, soft drink, Blood plasma
			- 'Homo' means 'same', 'Homogenous' means 'of the same kind'
		-Heterogeneous mix - non-uniform mix that has regions of differing composition
			- e.g. Blood, orange juice (pulp), oil and water, salad dressing
			- 'Hetero' means 'another', 'Heterogenous' means 'differing in kind'
	Components of a mixture can be physically separated w/o changing their identities

Anything in the periodic table is an element (e.g. Calcium, Sodium, Hydrogen, Uranium)
	- e.g. CaCl is not an element, it is a molecule (chemical -> compound -> molecule)

Even though pressure decreases, the composition would remain the same
	- Air would mostly remain the same in different areas

Chemical changes:
	- Substance -> new chemical due to chemical reaction

##### Micro scale
[[Old atomic theories]]
Dalton's Atomic Theory:
	1. Matter consists of atoms
	2. Atoms are indestructible -> they rearrange but don't break apart
	3. In any sample of pure element, all atoms are identical in mass/other properties
	4. Atoms of different elements differ in mass/other properties
	5. When different atoms combine to form a compound, the constituents are always present in the same fixed ratio -> e.g. H2O for water, NaCl for salt etc.
	We didn't know electrons existed at this point.

[[Laws]]
Law of Conservation of Mass - no detectable gain or loss of mass occurs in chemical reactions - mass is conserved
	-> 8H + 4O -> 4H2O
Law of Definite Proportions - a 1L bottle of water will have the same proportions of H${_2}$O as a 5L bottle
Law of Multiple Proportions - multiple different compounds can contain the same elements

Only whole atoms can combine, not fractions - you won't have an atom, you'd have an explosion or a serious problem.


[[Atomic Structure]]
The nucleus occupies <0.1% of the total atomic volume
	- Protons (+). # of protons determines element.
	- Neutrons (no charge). Atoms of same element can have varying # of neutrons, these are called isotopes
	- Electrons (-). 1/2000th the mass -> affects chemical properties. They are half-particles (dual wave), they are better represented as a cloud.
Atomic components w/ same charge repel, opposing charges attract
	- Protons repel one another
	- Protons and electrons attract on another
	- Electrons repel one another
	- Neutrons keep the atom just close enough to keep the atom from falling apart  ***???***

#### [[Isotopes]]
Have the same number of protons (i.e. atomic number), but different number of neutrons
	- Represented by showing it's mass number (A) as a superscript and it's atomic number (Z) as a subscript in front of the atomic symbol -> nuclear symbol.
	- www.isotopesmatter.com
	- Some exist as a single isotope, most have multiple common (e.g. Iron has 4)
```
A -> mass number
   X -> chemical symbol
Z -> atomic number (# of protons)
```
Regular hydrogen (protium) has one proton (1.008). Deuterium (1P, 1N -> mass of 2). Tritium (1P, 2N -> mass of 3). ${^1{^2}C}$ = Carbon 12. You don't have to bother with the atomic number.

Protons/Electrons/Neutrons in a uranium atom with atomic number 92 and mass number 235
	- 92 protons, 92 electrons *(negligible mass)*, 143 neutrons = 235


136 Barium 2+ -> P=56  N=80  E=54
Mass number - Protons = Neutrons
Electrons = Protons + -(ion count)
![[Periodic Table.webp|400]]

Some names are older names for the elements - Lead=Pb (Plumbum, Iron=Fe (Ferrum), Silver=AG (argentum)
International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) decides new names for elements

You can (very) simply classify elements within the periodic table as *metal* and *non-metal*.
	Metal:
		-Generally good conductors of heat & electricity
		-Are malleable and ductile
		-Have a metallic lustre
	Non-metals:
		-Poor conductors of heat and electricity
		-Generally gases at room temperatures and ambient pressure
		-Do not have a metallic lustre
	Metalloids.


Horizontal rows - *periods*
Vertical columns - *groups*

Group 1 - Alkali metals
	- Highly reactive
	- Shiny, soft metals
	- Can lose 1 electron to form cations with a charge of +1
Group 2 - Alkaline Earth Metals
	- Shiny, silvery-white metal
	- Not as reactive as alkali metals
	- Can lose 2 electrons to form cations with a charge of +2
Group 3 to 12 - Transition metals (includes two disconnected parts)
	- Hard, strong, shiny metal
	- Conductors of heat & electricity
	- Have high melting points
	- Can form different cations (many brightly coloured)
Group 17 - Halogens
	- Non-metal
	- Do not conduct electricity
	- All 'quite' toxic
	- Readily form anions with charge -1 (gains electron)
	- Are highly reactive
	- Less reactive as you go down the group	
Group 18 - Noble gases
	- Stable and unreactive
	- Do not form ions
	- Are gases at room temperature and ambient pressure
	- Are colourless and odourless
Lathanoids
	- all silvery white metals at room temperature
	- have high melting and boiling points
	- commonly used in many technological settings (generating solar energy, display in smartphone)
	- known as 'rare earth metals'

Universal indicators
	Blue = More basic
	Red = More acidic

'Vigorous' means faster reaction

If anything is removed from an atom - it is an electron

Atomic mass unit - 1.66054 \* 10${^2}{^4}$
	- Based on an atom of carbon that contain 6 protons and 6 neutrons. This carbon atom is considered to have a mass of exactly 12 atomic mass units.
	- Rounded to nearest number, that is the more common isotope (e.g. Boron = 10.94 -> Boron11 is more common)

Proton charge: +1.6022 \* 10${^1}{^9}$
	Weight: 1.6726 \* 10${^-}{^2}{^7}$ kg
		= 1.0073u
Electron charge: -1.6022 \* 10${^1}{^9}$
	Weight: 9.1094 \* 10${^-}{^2}{^7}$ kg
		=  5.4858 \* 10${^-}{^4}$ u
Neutron charge: 0
	Weight: 1.6726 \* 10${^-}{^2}{^7}$ kg
		= 1.0073u

```
Naturally occuring Copper (Cu) -> 69.17% of Cu63 w/ mass of 62.93 and 30.83% of Cu63 w/ mass of 64.93
-> Average = (62.93 * 0.6917) + (64.93 * 0.3083) = 63.5466u

Xq -> 2 isotopes (100u and 102u). A sample was found having 20% of Xq100 and 80% of Xq102.
-> Average = 100 * 0.2 + 102 * 0.8 = 101.6

Iron:
	1 - 53.9396u @ 5.80%
	2 - 55.9349u @ 91.72%
	3 - 56.9354u @ 2.20%
	4 - 57.9333u @ 0.28%

(53.9396 * 0.058) + (55.9349 * 0.9172) + (56.9354 * 0.022) + (57.9333 * 0.0028) = 55.84677912 = 55.846u
