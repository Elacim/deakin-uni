Normal melting/freezing/boiling point is calculated at a pressure of $1.013 \times 10^{5}$ Pa
Boiling, melting, and freezing points depend on intermolecular force strength
Vaporisation :: Liquid $\rightarrow$ gas
Condensation :: Gas $\rightarrow$ liquid
Melting :: Solid $\rightarrow$ liquid
Freezing :: Liquid $\rightarrow$ solid
How is the most stable state of a substance changed? :: Through changes in temperature and/or pressure

Three types of intermolecular forces that happen between molecules :: 1. Dispersion forces; 2. Dipolar forces; and 3. Hydrogen bonds

Dispersion forces :: The net attractive forces between negatively charged **electron clouds** & positively charged **nuclei** of neighbouring molecules; displayed in all substances
In one instance, the cloud may be more charged on one side than the other 
Why do dispersion forces occur? :: The electron cloud of an atom distorts in the direction of an atom's positively charged nucleus; the two electron clouds repel, further distorting the cloud; this distortion creates a charge imbalance
What is another name for dispersion forces? :: London dispersion forces (named after the German physicist Fritz London)
What do the magnitude of dispersion forces depend on? :: The ease of which the electron cloud of a molecule is distorted, named the polarisability; named an instantaneous dipole
Page 386-387: [[Chemistry Core Concepts - Allan Blackman, Daniel Southam, -exclude.pdf#page=386]]
Why would pentane ($C_{5}H_{12}$, $309K$) have a higher boiling point than 2,2-dimethylpropane ($C_{5}H_{12}$, $283K$)? :: Pentane must have a differing shape that extends the electron cloud, making it more polarisable than the presumed compact 2,2-dimethylpropane

Pressure: force exerted by column of air on you. Higher pressure - increased boiling point

Dipolar forces :: Also known as Dipole-Dipole forces, molecules with large dipole moment display dipolar forces
Why is the boiling point of ethanol ($C-C-O-H$) $376K$ vs. methoxyethane's ($C-C-O-C$) $305K$?

Hydrogen bonds :: A stronger dipole-dipole force that occurs between a $H^{+}$ atom and a highly electronegative atom
Needs $H-O; H-F; H-N$
What are the two requirements for hydrogen bonds? :: 1. There must be an electron-deficient hydrogen atom ($H^{+}$) that can be attracted to an electron pair; and 2. 
there must be a small, highly electronegative atom with an electron pair that can interact with the $H^{+}$ atom

Dispersion acts on all particles, so it is always applicable. We need to determine if it is the only force, or if there are hydrogen bonds or dipolar forces, and name which one is the main force.
a) Ethane - dispersion forces. Not a hydrogen bond as it is balanced and 
b) Ethyl Alcohol - dipolar, but hydrogen is the most important so hydrogen bond. This would have the highest boiling point.
c) Ethyl Chloride - polar bond, so dipolar force is more important than dispersion forces
- Is there a polar bond?
	- Yes? Is there a hydrogen bond that is uneven?
		- Yes -> Hydrogen bond
		- No -> Dipolar forces
	- No? -> Dispersion forces

There must be a polar bond to be considered a polar molecule - though a polar bond does not always mean a polar bond

$CCl_{4}$ - There are 4 dipolar forces acting against each other, cancelling each other out, meaning the only meaningful force acting on it is dispersion forces


### Gases
Ideal gas - theoretical gas that does not interact and is not messy in comparison to real gases
1. Gas consists of randomly fast moving particles with little to no attractive forces
2. The amount of occupied space is much smaller than the amount of space between particles
3. Average kinetic energy is proportional to kelvin
4. Collisions
- Only weak forces between themselves
- Pressure - dependent on altitude and the weather (lower at higher pressures where air density is less)
	- Manometer (measures gas pressure differences)
		- measured in pascal (Pa)
		- 1 pascal = $1Nm^{-2}$
		- 1atm = $1.01325 \times 10^5$ Pa
- At any temperature above $0K$, particles are always in motion - they're always exerting forces through constant collisions within each other and the container walls

Boyle's Law: Volume is inversely proportional to pressure
$p_{gas}V_{gas}=k$
$k$=temperature
Charles' Law: Gas volume is directly proportional to it's temperature (they go up together)
$V_{gas}=k'T_{gas}$
Gay-Lussac's law: The pressure of a fixed amount of gas at constant volume is directly proportional to it's Kelvin temperature. As temperature goes up/down, pressure follow suite. $\frac{p_{1}}{V_{1}}=\frac{p_{2}}{V_{2}}$
Combined gas law: If any of the three variables are constant, drop that variable from the equation
$\frac{P_{1}V_{1}}{T_{1}}=\frac{P_{2}V_{2}}{T_{2}}$

Avogadro's Law: Gas volume is directly proportional to the amount of gas $V_{gas}=kn'_{gas}$

The ideal gas equation: All four variables ($p, V, T, \& n$) can be related using a single constant - known as the gas constant $R$
- $pV=nRT$
$p$ = pascal (Pa), kilopascals works with litres
$V$ = cubic metre ($m^{3}$), litres works with kilopascals
$n$ = mole
$T$ = Kelvin (temperature)
$R$ = Gas constant ($8.314$ Pa $m^{3}$ mol$^{-1}K^{-1}$)

Given m=12g; T=110°C; p=$1.013 \times 10^{5}$, what is the volume?
$n=\frac{12.0g}{18.02gmol^{-1}}=0.666$
$1.013 \times 10^{5} \times V = 0.666mol \times 8.314Pa \times 110°C$  (110C=383.15K)
-> $0.666mol \times 8.314 \times 383.15K=\frac{2121.5490606}{1.013 \times 10^{5}}=0.02094m^{3}$
$\rightarrow \times 1000 = 20.94L$

Determine the volume of the same 12g of water if the temperature is 500°
$1.013 \times 10^{5} \times V=0.666mol \times 8.314 \times 773.15K$
-> $0.04226m^{3}$ $\times 1000=42.2608L$

A $1.000 \times 10^{3}L$ steel storage tank contains 88.5kg of methane ($CH_{4}$). If the temperature is 25°C, what is the internal pressure?
$pV=nRT$
$n=\frac{88.5kg}{16.0426M_{r}}=5516.562153mol$
$p \times (1 \times 10^{3}L)=n \times 8.314 \times 298.15K$
-> =$13,674.56kPa$

Gas density - varies significantly with given conditions - it has a significant effect on interactions between gas molecules
	- Frequency of collisions between each other and container walls depends on gas density
$p_{gas}=\frac{m}{V}=\frac{pM}{RT}$

Gas behaviour depends on gas atom/molecule count but not on their identity - they will eventually become homogenous due to diffusion (unlike liquids)

Dalton's law of partial pressures - in a mix of gases with no chemical reaction, each gas contributes to the total pressure ($P_{1}+P_{2}+P_{3}...p_{i}=p_{total}$)  ( will be on exam )

Mole fraction (x) - number of moles of a substance as a fraction of the number of moles of all substances in the mixture
mole fraction of $A=x_{A}=\frac{n_{A}}{n_{total}}$
- the partial pressure of a component in a gas mix is it's mole fraction $\times$ by the total pressure: $p_{A}=x_{A}p_{total}$

| Substance             | Relationship                   | Equation |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------- |
| Pure solid/liquid/gas | mol=mass/molar mass            |   n=m/M       |

### Liquids
Intermolecular forces are strong enough to confine molecules to a specific volume. They can move freely within a liquid. They do not keep their shape/significantly expand/contract

Intermolecular forces experienced by liquids :: Cohesive and adhesive forces
Cohesive forces ::  Attracts molecules in the liquid to one another 
Adhesive forces :: Attracts molecules in the liquid to the walls of the container

Surface tension :: Measure of resistance of a liquid to an increase in it's surface area (favouring less SA); net attractive force on molecules at the surface pulling them towards the liquid interior; caused by cohesive forces

Capillary action :: The upward movement of water against gravity; caused by adhesive forces

Viscosity :: Resistance to flow where the greater viscosity means a slower liquid; the ease of molecules sliding by one another
How do the molecules in a high viscosity liquid move? :: Slowly. They struggle to slide past one another.
What affects viscosity? :: Molecular shape; strength of intermolecular forces; and temperature

What is the effect of vapour pressure? :: The number of molecules in a liquid that have enough energy to escape into the vapour phase
What happens at the vapour pressure of a substance? :: Equilibrium is reached
What does vapour pressure depend on? :: Intermolecular force strength and temperature (increases as temperature increases)
How is the boiling point found? :: The point at which the vapour pressure is equal to the total pressure ($p_{vap}=p_{total}$) - the temperature of water at 100°C is total
How is vapour pressure found? :: Pressure at which a dynamic equilibrium between the liquid and gas phase is achieved in a closed container

Combined gas law: $\frac{P_{i}V_{i}}{n_{i} T_{i}}=R=\frac{P_{f}V_{f}}{n_{i} T_{f}}$
# Solids
[[W8 - Flashcards#Solids]]
Forces in solids range from very small to extremely large
Molecular solids are held together by - Intermolecular forces
- Crystals of benzoic acid are held by head-to-head hydrogen bonds, stacked in dispersion force held planes
	- between planes, dispersion forces keep them apart
- Two lone pairs on oxygen-hydrogen bonding (slide 61)
- relatively low melting/boiling points in comparison to other solids
Network solids are held together by covalent bonds
- very high melting points
- held by covalent bonds
- bonding patterns determine properties (e.g. diamond vs. graphite)
Metallic solids -> delocalised bonding
- regular array of metal atoms
- sea of mobile valence electrons
- ductile, lustrous, malleable, and conductive
- properties differ due to valence electron numbers
- melting points relate to position on the periodic table (group 1 = low melting; middle metals = high melting)
Ionic solids -> electrostatic interactions
- cation-anion attracted to each other (electrostatic forces)
- slide 65
^ crystalline solids
Amorphous solids
- pure liquid is cooled slowly -> solidifies as a crystalline solid
	- rejects impurities
	- rapid cooling may cause atoms etc. to become locked into non-crystalline structures
- means 'without form'

Phase change :: The transition of a substance from one phase (state) to another
What do phase changes depend on? :: Temperature, pressure, and the strength of intra-/inter-molecular forces; energy supplied or removed
Does temperature differ while a substance is changing phase? :: No. A substance must completely change phase before the temperature can differ

Slide 72-73
The heat needed to melt 1 mole of a substance at it's normal melting point? ::: Molar enthalpy of fusion ($\Delta_{fus}H$)
Molar enthalpy of fusion is the phase change {{solid}} to {{liquid}} transition :: Solid to liquid transition
The heat needed to vaporise 1 mole of a substance at it's normal boiling point ::: Molar enthalpy of vaporisation ($\Delta_{vap}H$)
Molar enthalpy of vaporisation is the phase change {{liquid}} to {{gas}} transition :: Liquid to gas transition
The heat needed to vaporise 1 mole of a substance from the solid phase ::: Molar enthalpy of sublimation ($\Delta_{sub}H$)
Molar enthalpy of sublimation is the phase change {{solid}} to {{gas}} transition :: Solid to gas transition

Aggregates of molecules bound together -> dispersion forces, dipolar, hydrogen bonding, or a combination of the three
	- many have dispersion forces strong enough to hold them together at room temperature


What does STP stand for? :: Standard temperature and pressure
What is the standard temperature and pressure? :: 0°C and 1 atmosphere
What is the standard lab temperature and pressure? :: 25°C and 1 atmosphere

# Questions
Vapour pressure - could you reexplain that? From what I understand, something is boiling when gas-liquid and liquid-gas is equal? 
Is this related to water evaporation in the ocean?
