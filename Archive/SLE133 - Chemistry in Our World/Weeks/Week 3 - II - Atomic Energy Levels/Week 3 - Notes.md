Aufbau principle - how [[Orbitals]] are filled as the number of electrons in an atom increase
1. Each electron occupies the most stable
- No two electrons can have the same [[Quantum numbers]]
- s:2; p:6; d:10; f:14 (L={0,1,2,3})
- This leads to the [[Periodic Table structure]]

### Valency
Only valence electrons (electrons on the outer shell) can be used for reaction
- e.g. Iodine -> 5s and 5p -> I has 7 valence electrons
- e.g. Chlorine -> 3s and 3p orbitals -> Cl has 7 valence
s and d-block: group number
p-block: group number - 10

Valence electrons are those in the occupied orbitals with the highest energy level. 

Count everything in the last shell - if  $1s{^2}2s{^2}2p{^6}3s{^2}3p{^6}4s{^2}$. There are 4s^2 (2 electrons) in the valence shell
	 $1s{^2}2s{^2}2p{^6}$ -> 6 electrons in valence

He - 1s^2 - s = 2
Ne - 2s^2 2p^6 - s+p = 8
Ar - 3s^2 3p^6 - s+p = 8
Kr - 4s^2 3d^10 4p^6 - s+p = 8
Xe - 5s^2 4d^10 5p^6 - s+p = 8
(energy level 5 electrons + energy level 5 electrons = valence electrons)

2+ degenerate orbitals -> lowest energy situation results when electrons occupy orbitals the keep them the furthest apart
Hund's Rule - lowest energy config involving orbitals of equal energies is the one with the max electrons in the same spin orientation

When orbitals are very close in energy (4s, 4d - Cr -> \[Ar]4s^1 3d^5), the shell 

Atoms and ions that have the same # of electrons are said to be *isoelectronic* 
- Fluorine adding an electron to get to Neon's 10 electrons
- Magnesium2+ -> Neon's 10

Boron: 1s^2 2s^2 2p^1
- 2s + 2p = 3 valence electrons
Molybdenum ($Mo$) - group 6 -  6 valence electrons

Cations are always smaller and anions larger than the corresponding neutral atom.
A cation will be at the previous shell, therefore being smaller, and anions at the next shell, therefore larger.
Greater positive charge shrinks the atom (valence electrons are more attracted to nucleus)

Electron spin = magnetic proprties. Unpaired electrons -> non-net zero spin and therefore is paramagnetic (attracted by strong magnet)
Amount of paramagnetism is proportional to # of unpaired electrons
With Fe (iron), the five d electrons all have the same spin (according to Hund's Law ^ ^ ^ ^ ^) so the net spin will be $5*\frac{1}{2}$
Most s & p blocks = diamagnetic
More likely d and f blocks = para

Atomic size increases from top to bottom of a group (n increases -> orbitals are larger)
Size decreases across a row (n is same, but more protons so electrons are pulled closer)

First Ionisation energy becomes more as you go across the columns and less down the rows. You need more ionisation energy for electrons further in shells.
Electron affinity - spontaneous energy released when an electron joins the gang
Ionisation becomes harder as cationic charge increases -> 2nd ionisation energy is *always* higher than 1st

Cr - 4s^1, 3d^5
Cu - 4s^1, 3d^10
The 3d subshells have a higher energy than 4s
