Characteristics of light
	Frequency (**v**) - # of crests passing a point in space (in Hz = crests/second)
		- Determines the colour we can see
	Wavelength (**Î»** - lambda) - distance between crests (maximums). Freq and wave are inversely proportional to each other (when one goes up, the other is going down). 
	Amplitude - max displacement of a wave from centre (intensity of the light)
	Phase - different starting/ending points (shifting left/right)
![[Wavelength & Frequency examples.png|200]]
Lambda = wavelength in meters
N nu (Greek nu) = frequency in Hz
Light moves at 2.998

##### Particle properties of light
Photoelectric effect -> when a light is shone on metal, it produces electrons and can complete a circuit
Below a certain freq, no electrons are emitted
Higher freq = electron energy increases linearly

Each photon's energy = planck's constant \* photon's frequency
Or -> freq * speed of light \\ wavelength


Atomic spectrum:
Shine light through a gaseous-element filled tube into a prism. This will then show up as the atomic spectrum.
	The energy absorbed by atoms moves them from a ground state to an excited state
		This is not stable though and it moves back to it's ground state, releasing photons in the process
	Each energy level the electron moves down has a different wavelength of light associated with it (n4->n2 might be 450nm - blue light, n2->n1 might be 30nm - UV light, n3->n1 might be 22nm)

Emission spectra:
![[Chemistry Core Concepts - Allan Blackman, Daniel Southam, -exclude.pdf#page=258]]

Electrons, when photons hit them, go up an energy state then back down near-immediately. When they move down, they release energy by emitting photons 

Quantum numbers - country, state, city, street
n - principle quantum number (country) - Bohr model: shell number (e.g. calcium on the 4th row)
	- Overall energy of electron
	- Positive integer (not a fraction) -> 1..Infinity (integers only)
	- Correlated to orbital size (higher n, higher orbital)
	- higher n -> electron has more energy, orbital is larger, and it is therefore less bound to the nucleus
L - azimuthal quantum number (state) - Bohr model: subshell (region of a shell - energy) w/ a certain shape
																	- has a number of degenerate orbitals (orbitals with same energy levels) 
	- Always \< n (can be zero)
	- Relates to angular momentum of orbital
	- Identifies electron distribution shape
	- L=1 -> s / L=1 ->p / L=2 -> d orbital
m$_{l}$ - magnetic quantum number - Bohr model: which orbital ()
	- Relates to possible orientations
	- Can be positive/negative int between zero and L
	- 2L + 1 possible values for m
		- for n=1, only l=0 is possible, so ml can only = 0
		- for n=2, two values of L (0 or 1)
			- for L=0, m=0       for L=1, m=-1, 0 or 1
		- for n=3, 3 L values (0, 1, or 2)
			- For L=2, ml={-2, -1, 0, 1, or 2}

m$_{s}$ - spin quantum number. Up/down, 
	- electrons in same orbital cannot have the same spin
	- behaves 2 ways in a magnetic field (spin up or down)
	- +1/2 or -1/2 for each electron

Pauli exclusion principle - each electron has a unique set of quantum numbers according the given rules. This means you can't have more than two electrons within the same orbital (as there are only 2 spin values)
Beyond a certain measurement, you physically can't know the position and momentum to an accurate degree

1s orbital = 2 electrons
2s and 2p orbitals = 2 + 6 -> 8 electrons

s - 1 orbital  - 2 elements on first row of periodic table
p - 3 orbitals - "" ""

3s -> 3rd shell 
3p - 3rd shell - different orbitals

For n=2, there is a total of 4 orbitals -> called 2s and 2p (three of these). Each orbital can hold 2 electrons, which means there can be a max num of 8 electrons 
For n=3, there is a total of 9 orbitals, called 3s, 3p (three of these), and 3d (five of these). Each can hold 2 electrons, which means a max of 18 numbers.

Electron density - more often an electron is found, the higher the density. Rarer = lower density.
Orbitals describe regions in space where there is a probability of finding an electron.

-- Orbital size --
- Orbitals are larger for larger values of n
- Specific orbital becomes *smaller* as nuclear charge increases

Periodic table: Left to right -> Positive charge increases

Quantum number l=0 corresponds to an s orbital.

Nuclear charge:
As protons increase (+ charge) -> more likely to find the electron closer to the nucleus.
Ripping out electrons gets harder and harder as you go.
Ionisation energy - the amount of energy to remove an electron completely

In multi-electron electrons atoms, electrons affect each other
Shielding:
	Electron-electron repulsion cancels some nucleus-electron attraction
	An outer electron experiences less charge than full nuclear charge - called the effective nuclear charge $Z_{eff}$



Q1 - amplitude of light is = intensity -> true
Q2 - atom will reach an excited state when hit by a photon -> true-ish (when energy is enough)
Q4 - no set of same quantum numbers ->88 true
Q9 - all orbitals having the same value of L have the same energy and are said to be degenerate - true -> everything in a p/d/f/g shell are degenerate. They are the same in every way except orientation.
Q10. Most stable means that the electrons occupy the lowest enery orbitals available -> true - ground state 
Q15 - sodium wavelength = 690nm - freq?
```
c = lambda * nu
speed of light = 690 * 10^-1 * nu
frequency = 3.0*10^8 m/s divided by 690*10^-9m
```

An atom needs to be hit with the exact level of energy by a photon (the right wavelength) - the photon'll pass through otherwise.
X-rays can be dangerous because when an atom is hit by enough energy, the electron 'falls out'

Absorption spectra - what happens when you go up an energy state
Emission spectra - what happens when you go down an energy state

Valence electrons - available for reactions. Core electrons - inaccessible.
