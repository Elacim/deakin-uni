$15\%=\frac{15}{100}$
$15\% \text{ of } 480=(\frac{15}{100})\times 480=72$

Avogadro's number :: $6.022 \times 10^{23}$
[[Catch Up Maths & Stats, second - Harris, Michael;Taylor, Gordon -exclude.pdf#page=136&selection=54,0,68,6|Mole count]] = $\frac{\text{mass of sample (g)}}{\text{relative molecular mass (u)}}$
	360.36g of glucose = $\frac{360.36g}{180.18u}=2 \text{ mol}$
Concentration = $\frac{\text{amount}} {\text{volume}}$
Molarity ($M$) - concentration expressed as the number of moles/Litre 
[[Catch Up Maths & Stats, second - Harris, Michael;Taylor, Gordon -exclude.pdf#page=136&selection=100,0,100,8|Molarity]] = $\frac{\text{mol count}}{\text{volume (L)}}$
A $1M$ solution of $NaCl$ contains $58.44g/\text{litre}$

Triangle -> $m$ up top (mass - $\text{g}$), $n$ bottom left (mole count - $\text{mol}$), $M$ bottom right (relative molecular mass - $\text{g/mol}$ or $\text{g mol}^{-1}$)

Concentration of a $2M$ $NaCl$ solution. $NaCl=58.44u$
	-> $1L$ of $2M$ = $2M \times 58.44u=116.88g$  (molarity times molecular weight)
	-> In 100mL, $116.88 \times \frac{100mL}{1L}=11.688g$
		-> $2M$ $NaCl$ solution $=$ $11.7\%w/v$ $NaCl$ solution

How many moles of element: $\frac{\text{amount of atoms}}{\text{avogadro's constant}}$

$C_1V_1=C_2V_2$ $\text{conc. of stock solution } \times \text{ req. vol. of stock solution} = \text{req. conc. of new solution} \times \text{req. vol. of new solution}$

Fraction dividing -> $\frac{3}{4}\div \frac{5}{6}=\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{6}{5}=\frac{18}{20}=\frac{9}{10}$
Fraction adding -> $\frac{2}{3} + \frac{4}{5}=\frac{10}{15} + \frac{12}{15}=\frac{22}{15}$
Fraction cancelling -> $\frac{365.25 \times 80 \times 7}{365.25 \times 80 \times 24} \rightarrow \frac{\cancel{365.25} \times \cancel{80} \times 7}{\cancel{365.25} \times \cancel{80} \times 24} \rightarrow \frac{7}{24}$
Think of percentages as compare this to this ($\frac{\text{this}}{\text{to this}}$)

Addition/subtraction in scientific notation -> $4.41 \times 10^{7} - 7.9 \times 10^{5}$mm$^{3}$
-> Convert to the same power (in this case, move 4.41 two decimal points to the right to match $10^5$) $4.41\times10^{7}\rightarrow 441 \times 10^{5}$
-> Add/subtract: $441 \times 10^{5} - 7.9 \times 10^{5} = 433.1 \times 10^{5} \rightarrow 4.331 \times 10^7$

0.015mm to m -> $1.5 \times 10^{-2}$mm. mm->m=$\div 1000$. $\frac{1.5 \times 10^{-2}}{1000}=1.5 \times 10^{-5}$

$x^{-2}=\frac{1}{x^{2}}$
$x^{\frac{1}{2}}=\sqrt{x}$
$x^\frac{2}{3}=\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}=(\sqrt[3]{x})^{2}$
$(\frac{x}{a})^{2}=\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}$

$r >0.9$

Data types
- Quantitative (numerical)
	- continuous or discrete
- Qualitative (non-numerical)
	- nominal ()
	- ordinal

Standard Error of the Mean (SEM) purpose :: Tells you how much the sample mean would vary if the study were repeated with new samples within a single population
Estimates the efficiency, accuracy, and consistency of a sample
Standard Error of the Mean (SEM) ::: An indication of the closeness of a sample's mean to the larger population; sample mean is likely to vary from population mean; larger samples give a tighter value
SEM formula :: $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$  (standard deviation over the root of the sample count)

Co-efficient of variation (CV) :: The comparison of sample variabilities from populations with differing means
Co-efficient of variation purpose :: To find how much the taken sample's $\sigma$ varies from populations with differing means (the extent of variability)
CV formula :: $\frac{\sigma}{\bar{x}}$ (standard deviation's ratio to the mean)

Variance :: How individual numbers relate to one another - treats all 

P-value :: 0.05 = 95% confidence. If $p<\alpha$, the test is significant
t-test :: Compares samples of normally distributed data with similar standard deviations
	NOT GOOD FOR COMPARING TWO+ MEANS DUE TO 5% CHANCE OF FALSE POSITIVES
Unpaired t-test :: The comparison of the means of two separate samples (e.g. 10 of your chicken eggs' weight compared to next door farmer's chicken egg weight)
Paired t-test :: The comparison of of the means using two observations on one sample (e.g. 10 chicken eggs mean weight one day then the next day)
One-sample t-test :: The comparison of a fixed mean to a single sample's mean (e.g. 10 your chicken's egg to national standard)
Two-tailed t-test :: You want to know if there is a difference (proves hypothesis)
One-tailed t-test :: You want to know the direction of the difference

Correlation coefficient ($r$) :: -1.0 = perfect negative correlation, 0=perfect positive, 1.0 = perfect positive
Correlation - info about the strength of the linear association (not about cause/effect)
	- sample size dependent

Regression analysis :: The quantification of the association between two variables (line of best fit - $y=mx+c$)

Chi-square tests :: Measure of the difference between actual and expected frequencies (e.g. expected=$1:1$, observed=$0.38:0.62$)
Degrees of freedom :: $df=n-1$
