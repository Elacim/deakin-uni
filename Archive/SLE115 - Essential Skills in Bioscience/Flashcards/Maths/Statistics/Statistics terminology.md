Population :: All the possible items that could be studied
Sample :: A selected section of the population
Pros of a large sample size :: High-quality representation; 
Cons of a large sample size :: Hard to test every subject; Hard to access; Financially fraught
Names for individuals in a sample :: Sample units, subjects, or cases
Name for data collected from samples :: Observations; a collection of observations is called data
A collection of observations is called {{data}} :: Data
What are the studied differences between individuals in a population called? :: Variables (or sometimes fields)

Observer bias :: Conscious or unconscious bias towards samples from the researcher
Best way to avoid bias when selecting samples :: Random selection

Null hypothesis :: The hypothesis where there are no statistically significant changes in the dependent variable

Adherence to design :: The principle where unexpected results are not abandoned; well-designed, planned, and executed plans are probably true

Post- and pre-treatment study
### Sampling methods
Systematic random :: The sampling of subjects starting at a random point and collecting at regular intervals
Systematic random biases :: 

Simple random :: Each member of a population has an equal probability of being selected, allowing better representation of the population

Stratified random :: The population is divided into groups based on a characteristic like height, weight, age, or species

Technical replication :: One unit with multiple tests (e.g. 1 sample/10 minutes)
Biological replication :: Multiple units with one test (e.g. 5 samples/once)

### Variables 
What are variables? :: The differences between individuals in a population. The property of interest may take on different values (e.g. height; weight; age; or morbidity) expressed in appropriate units

Dependent variable (DV) :: Variable we hypothesise will alter as a consequence of manipulation (the thing we are measuring, the response) - on the y-axis 
Independent variable (IV) :: Variable we manipulate in an experiment; controlled by researcher - on x-axis (think 'manipulated variable' or 'cause'. The 'if' part)
Extraneous variables :: Any other factors that can affect the relationship between the independent and dependent variables; must be controlled or reduced as much as possible; working in a lab allows conditions to be controlled 

Continuous variables :: Variables that can take any range of values
Categorical variables :: Variables where only certain values can exist 
Categorical variable types ::: Nominal and ordinal
Nominal variable ::: No ordering to categories (such as green pea, white pea) with no splits (e.g. no 'half green pea')
Ordinal variable ::: Ordering to categories (such as 1st, 2nd and 3rd) with no way to extrapolate information from one to the next (e.g. 1st $\times$ 3 $\ne$ 3rd)
Binary variable ::: Variable with only two categories

Descriptive statistics :: Statistics that **describe** data in a sample with tools like mean, mode, median, standard deviation etc. 
Inferential statistics :: Statistics that make **inferences** about the population given the collected sample data (predictive)

Quantitative data ::: Data that is quantifiable with numbers
Qualitative data ::: Data that is



What is 'accuracy' in terms of statistics? ::: How close to the mean (or accepted vaule) a given data point is
What is 'precision' in terms of statistics? ::: How grouped together different measurements of the same item are
