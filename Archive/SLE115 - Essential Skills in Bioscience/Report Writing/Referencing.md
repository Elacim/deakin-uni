Deakin uses Deakin-Harvard/Australian Harvard
In-text citations (author date)
	One author -> (Hudson 2008)
	Two authors -> (Hudson and Buskes 2008; James, Crisp and Fredo 2008)
	Four+ -> (Hudson et al. 2010) \[et al is Latin for 'et alii', meaning 'and others']
		'et al.' - the period is necessary as it's a shortened phrase
The first author should always be first - order by lead author's surname

Title: Feasibility versus sustainability in urban water management
Journal: Journal of Environmental Management volume 71, issue 3,
pages 245 to 260
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2004.03.004
Authors: Markus Starkl and Norbert Brunner
Year: 2004
How would this appear in a Deakin-Harvard reference list?
Stakl M and Brunner N; (2004) 'Feasibility versus sustainability in urban water management', *Journal of Environmental Management*, 71(3):245-260, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2004.03.004
The DOI can also be like:
"..., \doi:10.1016/j.jenvman.2004.03.004"
You can also put colons between each entry like:
Stakl M and Brunner N; (2004); 'Feasibility versus sustainability in urban water management'; *Journal of Environmental Management*; 71(3):245-260; \doi:10.1016/j.jenvman.2004.03.004

You can use AI to help generate topic sentences/search terms - just about nothing else (both for cheating reasons and AI not being up-to-scratch quality-wise)

Footnotes are not a common practice - though they are awesome.

The ATLAS collaboration has 3,171 authors - it's referred to as this instead of 'et. al' - this is an extreme edge case.

Reference list must be alphabetical -> lead author is still first listed regardless of alphabetical order in the reference.

The correct order is 
3, 4, 1, and then 2
4 is first as there is only one author.
If there were multiple authors in 4, the 2010 one would go first.
If there are two+ entries with the same authors, no matter what, base it on year. 

-> Alphabetical order of author's name
	-> Same author? Order based on year.
	-> Multiple authors? Order by author's name/given order
		-> Same author(s)? Order based on year (no matter the author count)

In the PDF, the reference list needs to be in Alphabetical order. Deveny C needs to be one ahead.
Burdess - Book
Catts M - Chapter/article in an edited book ('in' Authors)
Cooke H - Online book
Cotteral S and Cohen R - Journal article
Deveny C - Newspaper article
