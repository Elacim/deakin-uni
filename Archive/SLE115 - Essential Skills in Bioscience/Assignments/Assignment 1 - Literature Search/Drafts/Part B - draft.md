# Introduction:
###### General statement(s)
- For centuries, windmills replaced human power in order to grind wheat faster, allowing humans to automate a necessary yet dour task by harnessing wind. 
- The primary 
- Energy-dense fossil fuels have long been a golden goose since the Industrial Revolution, providing humanity with endless technological progression with no end in sight. The goose is more like a double-edged sword. Pushing forward technologic progression yet being the leading cause of climate change due to burning them emitting harmful greenhouse gases. Due to the latter, there has been continuous research into finding less damaging and still competitive alternatives to fossil fuels. 
- With the industrial revolution, energy-dense fossil fuels replaced manual labour, which, like a double-edged sword, has pushed forward technological progress and has been the leading cause of climate change through harmful by-products. Given the latter, there has been continuous research into finding less damaging and still competitive alternatives to fossil fuels .

###### Specific topic
Methods of making algal-based biofuels a feasible competitive cohabitant of fossil fuels with large amounts of funding have been propositioned and researched since the 1970s (Westervelt A, 2023). This essay will discuss the current status, new technologies, and challenges of algal biofuels and discuss if they will be a competitor.  
	- 'Diesel and biodiesel have largely similar productivity...' (https://doi.org/10.1080/01430750.2018.1451380)
- They presently face numerous challenges in regards to lacking developed technologies for scaling up past experimental studies. 
	- regarding biodiesel, fuel consumption is greater than diesel 
###### Thesis statement
Algal-based biofuels have an arduous, but attainable, path to gain feasibility as a non-competitive cohabitant with fossil fuels. 

###### Outline
- Algae types (seaweeds, etc.)
- This essay will discuss whether or not algal-based biofuels will be capable of becoming a reality within daily life and not as scientific curiosity through analysis into the necessities of a new technology becoming industrialised. - primary downside is inefficiency - the sheer amount of energy is a bit silly
**Topic 1:** Positive and negative factors enhancing growth and output
**Topic 2:** Challenges with scaling up algae-biofuel production
**Topic 3**: New and current technologies are seeing progress


# Body
###### Topic 1 - Factors affecting growth are being researched (positive and negative)
- enhancing lipid yield
	- (Page 4, section 3)[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2021.111270](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2021.111270)
		- environmental stress helps, nitrogen and phosphorus starvation, lower light energy and a not too much throughout the day, quality depends on light frequencies  
- Biological harmers
	- disease/fungi (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.2c07031)
	- grazers [Day J G, Gong Y, Hu Q; 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211926417303570)
- [Light](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-7737/10/10/1060)
	- Differing frequencies, intensities, amounts
		- absorption of photons can be optimised
	- Challenges come in with different algal species/strains
		- N. Oceania, N. Oculata, N. Salina have a range of 4% of lipid count when exposed to the same frequency of light. Small differences like this can add up  [Page 4, section 3]([https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2021.111270](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2021.111270))


###### Topic 3 - New technologies are being invented constantly (hopeful, some doubt due to energy intensiveness)
- Hydrothermal liquefaction
- Coal seam gas industry - innovative technique
- Flue gas and wastewater
- genetic engineering ([https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2021.111270](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2021.111270), page 8, section 4.2)


###### Topic 2 - Challenges involved with scaling up algae-biofuel production (primarily negative, some positivity)
- Resource-intensive usage issues, 
	- primarily drying [DOI - s:3.2, para 5](https://doi.org/10.3390/app10228181), water usage (90% recycle rate), if using chemicals - large amounts are needed and energy is needed to remove solvent later
- A national scale is ridiculous (https://doi.org/10.1021/es4055719) -> a reasonable price must be reached; resource consumption must be at or below national levels;
	- 
- To tie it all together - [A major source of funding for research, big oil, has stopped providing funds](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/17/big-oil-algae-biofuel-funding-cut-exxonmobil)
	- The last organisation (ExxonMobil) in Big Oil just stopped funding. 
	- liquid fuels may not be the future
	- billions of funding, not pennies



# Conclusion 



Glossary: 
**Golden Goose** - an ironic reference to the Golden Goose fable where a farmer finds a golden goose laying golden eggs. He kills the goose in hopes to find gold inside, only to have a dead goose and nothing else. In regards to fossil fuels, they have been pumping out gold
- this makes no sense
