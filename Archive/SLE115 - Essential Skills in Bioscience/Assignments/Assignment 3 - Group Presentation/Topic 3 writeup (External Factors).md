- Geography, devil abundance, food availability ([[#Article 5 [https //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6927850/]]] “Monitoring the spread of DFTD”, para. 4), and seasons [[#Article 1 - doi.org/10.1111/mec.16408|Article 1]]
	- Geography 
	- Devil abundance
	- Food availability
	- Seasons
- Monitoring difficulties (not finding any infected devils in suspected regions, difficulty in diagnosing tumours as misc. wounds look similar)
	- The public is helping report (“Reports to the STDP through roadkill sightings or the hotline used by the general public have proved effective”)
	- Motion sensing cameras [[#Article 5 [https //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6927850/|Article 5]]]
	- Wounds looking similar (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21383118/ - Abstract), ways to differentiate
		- Tests for expression of Periaxin - shows specificity for Schwann cells and works as a tool for detecting DFTD cells

- Changing immune systems over age can increase the risk of developing cancers (immunosenescence) ("Immune gene expression profiling of devil whole blood samples has previously demonstrated that devils are subjected to immunosenescence") [[#Article 1 - doi.org/10.1111/mec.16408]]
- Expression of immune genes in blood may be affected by seasons, age, and sex. These are modified by DFTD infections.
