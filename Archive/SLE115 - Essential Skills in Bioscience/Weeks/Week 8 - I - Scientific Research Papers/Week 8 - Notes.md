Don't submit to the wrong journal ya numpties
	- reputable
	- right aim
	- right scope
	- same values
	- impact factor
	- relevance
Journal economic models
- journals are by subscription - Deakin paid 6 million in 2017
- reviewers aren't paid for their work (potential bias)
Predatory journals 
	- journals that do not rigorously review submissions
	- little-no geographical diversity
	- gender bias
	- search engines are banned from crawling
	- PDFs are locked
	Red flags in emails:
		- Overenthusiasm
		- Wrong journal for your field of work
		- Feeding ego
		- Not knowing correct titles
		- Not giving name
Impact factor - metric for journal quality
	- the amount of external citations for the average article in a journal
		- e.g. impact factor of 4 means on average, there were 4 citations/article published to a journal
	- More specific journals would have less impact factor, though not necessarily bad
	- Not reliable - journals can change what articles are included; citation are not always positive; closed database held by a private company; review articles are heavily cited
		- impact factors shouldn't be used to assess individuals/institutions

Scopus.com is good for finding relevant journals - shows metrics outside of impact factor to gauge the journal's quality and relevance

Getting published
1. Experiment
	1. Plan, collect data, analyse data
2. Write paper according to guidelines
	1. Submit electronically -> Journal will say if it's suitable -> comments by ~3 reviewers
	2. Edit paper according to comments and resubmit by a given deadline
3. Possible second review of paper
	1. Author will be notified of whether or not it is accepted
	2. If accepted, a proof will be sent
This whole process can take 6-12 months for it to appear as it is rigorous

Reliability and potential bias
	- read journal article / research report`
		- Media and claims can be biased
	- Critically evaluate the research on it's own merits
		- Do it regardless of publish status (regardless of if it's a in a journal/book/online)
		- Ask yourself: Are the findings and conclusions supported by the study design, method, data, and results?
			- Are they over-extrapolating? Is the significance over-reported?
	- Conflict of interest (not always disclosed)
		- Who financed the research (directly/indirectly)?
		- Who did/controlled the research? Who benefits from the findings?

[**C.R.A.A.P** test to find if an article/journal/media piece etc. is worthwhile?](https://researchguides.ben.edu/source-evaluation)
**C**urrency - Is the source up-to-date? Timeliness of the information 
**R**elevance - How much info is represented? Is it superficial? Is the writing appropriate?
**A**uthority - Who are the authors? What are their credentials? Peer-reviewed? Published by popular
**A**ccuracy - Does source match understanding? Can you verify the claims? What types of sources? Are the sources relevant?
**P**urpose - Is the subject approached objectively? Are there author biases?
Start with peer-reviewed to limit time spent

### Formatting journal articles
![[SLE115 Week 08 -exclude.pdf#page=15]]

- Do not write out all the materials and methods
- Do not add personal pronouns ("we added the solution" -> "the solution was added")

Titles and abstracts are extremely important - databases generally search these and they give the reader a good view into the article
Be specific. Some articles do 'funny title': 'formal title'
Avoid uncommon and field-specific acronyms
Use simple word order
Be descriptive

:: Abstract ::
- Single paragraph summarising the article
- Discuss question of article, methods, results, and conclusions
- Determine major points from the abstract
- Write after the paper is finished so you don't steer yourself wrong
> Starting sentence indicates significance for doing the work (i.e. why it was done)
> What was done
> How it was done
> What was found out
> Closing sentence indicating significance of findings

- Should be well-developed paragraph
- Don't be judgemental (maybe "it's contradictory to other's findings")
- Avoid long-winded, complex sentences, and excessive jargon usage
- Define abbreviations/acronyms
- Stick to a 150-250 word limit

- 1-2 sentences for intro (specific info)
- Most of the abstract is data (method/results) - generalised and not too in-the-weeds
- 1-2 sentences of discussion (what data means & summary of work)
- A phrase/sentence stating the importance of the work (at very end or very start of the abstract)
