#### [Independent and Dependent variables](https://www.thoughtco.com/independent-and-dependent-variables-differences-606115)
-> An independent variable is the variable that is changed or controlled in a scientific experiment to test the effects on the dependent variable.
-> A dependent variable is the variable being tested and measured in a scientific experiment.
The dependent variable is 'dependent' on the independent variable. As the experimenter changes the independent variable, the effect on the dependent variable is observed and recorded.
