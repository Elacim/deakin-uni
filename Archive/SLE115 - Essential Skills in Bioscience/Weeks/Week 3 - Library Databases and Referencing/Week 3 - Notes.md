Government papers
Newspapers/magazines

#### Selecting sources
Especially when using internet sources, analyse it:
- Who wrote it?
- Why did they write it?
- Does it give a balanced view?
- Does it make reference to other sources?

#### Why use sources?
- To show that you have explored many avenues of the concepts at hand
- To show you have derived from credible sources 
- To convince the reader - include sources (expert opinions/ideas/facts) - support argument/point
- Provide evidence to support a POV
- 

Example of the power of evidence:
1. Chocolate is good for you.
2. Chocolate is good for you because it contains antioxidants (Burnie 
2012).
3. A recent medical study conducted by Burnie (2012) showed that the 
antioxidants in chocolate improved the health of 76% of participants.
The 3rd item is most convincing because it is backed by statistics and a (hopefully) credible source.

#### When to [[Referencing|reference]] sources 
- Direct quotes (max 10% of word count - assignment dependent)
	- (Author(s) \<year>:\<page number>)
	- Single quote marks
	- Exact wording
	- Definitions, specific terms, or a particularly effective/powerful/controversial statement
	- **Use sparingly; tactfully**
- Indirect quotes / paraphrases
	- (Author(s) \<year>)	
	 - Use most frequently
	- Words/structure change, not the meaning
	- No quotation marks
	- If struggling, try to understand the text better (more background research)
- Summarised ideas
	- (Author(s) \<year>)
	- Used occasionally
	- Not the same wording, meaning must stay the same. Include only main ideas.
	- No quotation marks

- Statistics 
- Graphs
- Tables
You don't need to reference common knowledge.
