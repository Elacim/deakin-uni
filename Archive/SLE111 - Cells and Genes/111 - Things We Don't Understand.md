Plants and some species of algae exhibit a second type of life cycle called alternation of generations (Figure 13.6b ). This type includes both diploid and haploid stages that are multicellular. The multicellular diploid stage is called the sporophyte. Meiosis in the sporophyte produces haploid cells called spores. Unlike a gamete, a haploid spore doesnâ€™t fuse with another cell but divides mitotically, generating a multicellular haploid stage called the gametophyte. Cells of the gametophyte give rise to gametes by mitosis. Fusion of two haploid gametes at fertilisation results in a diploid zygote, which develops into the next sporophyte generation. Therefore, in this type of life cycle, the sporophyte generation produces a gametophyte as its offspring, and the gametophyte generation produces a sporophyte. The name alternation of generations fits well for this type of life cycle.

Meiosis produces daughter cells with genetically ... makeup :: Distinct. Mitosis produces identical.
How are 4 daughter cells produced from one germ cell (using humans as an example)? :: The DNA is duplicated before Meiosis I, meaning there are `46*2=92` chromosomes. Each daughter cell (gamete) is haploid (1n) compared to somatic cells being diploid (2n). These gametes therefore receive half as much DNA - therefore, `92/4=23` chromosomes per cell

Is saying male (antheridia) and female (archegonia) plant sex organs are attached to the gametophyte similar to saying the ovaries and testes are attached to our body?
