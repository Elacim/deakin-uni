**Content**

The same basic structure as a scientific report:  
◦ Introduction  
◦ Methods  
◦ Summary of findings –results  
◦ Discussion  
Talks should be a maximum of 8 minutes (plus 2 for questions)  
General rule of thumb is 1 slide per min (does not include title or reference slides)

**Introduction**

- Background (research on enzymes or catalase)
- Context (what do we as the audience need to know to understand what you are doing and presenting? Assume the audience has a scientific background, but knows nothing about your experiment)
- Aim/Hypothesis/Justification (what are you hoping to find out/achieve?)

**Methods**

- How can you show your methods most clearly?
- Would images or video be useful?
- Assume that the audience was not present in the lab
    - But they do still have a scientific background

**Summary of Findings (results)**

DO NOT INCLUDE RAW DATA TABLES

- It is a difficult way to interpret the data
- You cannot see trends or patterns easily
- See the section in this book titled "_Data Analysis_" for resources

**Discussion**

- Do you have any 'weird' or unexpected results?
- What are the broader implications of this research?
- How could your experiment be improved in future?

**Closing Credits**

- Acknowledges the contribution of each group member
    - What they did
    - How they contributed
- Acknowledges additional resources used
    - Clear referencing in Deakin-Harvard format
