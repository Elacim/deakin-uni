# Comparative analysis of catalase activity in various vegetable sources
**Hypothesis**
Different vegetables sources in the catalase reaction will result in varying rates of oxygen release, indicating that catalase activity differs among vegetables
**Null hypothesis**
Different vegetable sources will not show different catalase levels between them

**Equipment**
- Celery, onion, mushroom, and carrot - used as the independent variables
- Knives - used for slicing and dicing of vegetable to create maximal surface area
- Kitchen scales - weighing out amount of vegetable source 
- Universal buffer (pH 7) - to maintain a constant pH and as a solution for the reaction to occur
- Detergent - to visualise the capturing of oxygen from the reaction
- Timers - to keep time
- 10% hydrogen peroxide - to react with the catalase enzyme within the vegetable sources
- Autopipette - to measure out Hydrogen Peroxide 
- Measuring cylinders - to measure out universal buffer, as a container for the reaction, and to measure out the bubbles produced from the reaction
- Room temperature (19-25°C) - a consistent temperature for use a control variable

**Controls**
We will have a control of one vegetable. Anymore than that is a waste. All aerobic organisms contain catalase, so we can say with a high degree of certainty that one vegetable will be a plentiful base.

**Variables that will remain consistent**
- The amount (20mL) of pH 7 buffer
- 3 drops of detergent
- 2mL 10% Hydrogen Peroxide
- Consistent room temperature varying between 19-25°C
- 5g of a given vegetable

**Positive control - Celery with Hydrogen Peroxide**
Aerobic organisms all contain the catalase enzyme meaning the celery should produce oxygen, shown by the bubbles

**Negative control - Celery without Hydrogen Peroxide**
We will test the celery without the Hydrogen Peroxide as we know it will not react in a neutral pH (non-acidic) solution

**Independent variable:** Vegetable source
**Dependent variable:** Bubbles produced from the production of oxygen

**Replicates**
We will do each test with each vegetable source three (3) times to account for human error and to create a mean production of $O_{2}$ bubbles

**Changes to basic protocol described and justified**
We will repeat the experiment for all vegetable sources 3 separate times, resulting in a total of 12 different experiments
*Positive control* - No changes to treatment from basic protocol
*Negative control* - Not using Hydrogen Peroxide in the treatment

**Method**
Primary Procedure
1. Using a razor blade, carefully cut the celery into fine pieces (WARNING:
Sharps; risk of cuts; use great care. RISK: Low).
2. Using the balance, weigh out 5 grams of the finely cut celery.
3. Pipette 20 mL of Universal buffer (pH7) into a 100 mL measuring cylinder.
4. To the cylinder add 3 drops of detergent and gently swirl until buffer and
detergent are mixed. Avoid creating bubbles.
5. To the cylinder add 5 g of finely sliced celery. If the pieces are stuck to the
sides, push them down into the buffer solution.
6. Make a note of the volume in each cylinder and record it in your data
sheet. This is essential to calculate the rate of reaction.
7. If you are completing more than one test label each cylinder according to the
test it belongs to, and set the timer for 15 minutes.
8. To the measuring cylinder add 2 mL 10% hydrogen peroxide and immediately
start the timer.
9. Note the volume of foam created in the measuring cylinder and record it
in your datasheet after 5, 10 & 15 minutes.
10. Repeat each step with mushrooms, carrots, and onions
