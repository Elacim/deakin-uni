Experimental plan

The goal of this experiment is to modify the basic protocol demonstrated above to investigate the effect of a variable (substrate concentration, temperature, pH or vegetable source) on enzyme activity. You should have been assigned this variable in practical 1. Together with your group, you will plan how this experiment will run (What parameters would have been the same as the basic protocol and what parameter would have been changed?  What controls would you need? How many replicates do you need? Why?) This is what you will write up and submit as your experimental plan. To help with the experimental design process the following blog posts are a good introduction to the basics:

You also might like to make a prediction (or hypothesis) about what you think the results of the experiments might be (you can include this in your introduction of your report) for each of your variables. Making a prediction requires some background knowledge. There is a [reading list](https://moodle.deakincollege.edu.au/pluginfile.php/821728/mod_book/chapter/166837/Reading%20list%20SLE111.pdf?time=1687408991748) which you may find useful for your experimental plan and presentation available under Information & Resources.
