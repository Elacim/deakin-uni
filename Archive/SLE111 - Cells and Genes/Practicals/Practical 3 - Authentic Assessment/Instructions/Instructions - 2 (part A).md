For practical 3 there is no worksheet. Your assessment is to design an experimental plan as a group to test your specific variable (e.g. temperature, pH, etc), to perform your designed experiment in prac 3, and to present your results in a group presentation in Practical 4. Please see the rubric for information on what is expected of you.
Experimental plan - Part A (6 marks)

The experimental plan should be a PDF document consisting of no more than 2 typed A4 pages. It will be due prior to practical 3. Please check the submission folder for the exact date and time. This plan should document and justify your choice of:

    equipment
    controls
    replicates
    changes to basic protocol

It should also demonstrate that you have clearly considered the factors above, and how they might impact on the variable that you are testing.
