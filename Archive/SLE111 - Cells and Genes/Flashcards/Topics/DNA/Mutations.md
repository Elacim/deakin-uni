Deletion :: A chromosomal segment/nucleotide sequence is removed
Duplication :: A chromosomal segment/nucleotide sequence is duplicated
Inversion :: A chromosomal segment/nucleotide sequence is inverted (e.g. `ABCDE` become `ADCBE`)
Translocation :: A chromosomal segment/nucleotide sequence is moved from a chromosome to a non-homologous chromosome
Reciprocal translocation :: A chromosomal segment/nucleotide sequence is moved from a chromosome to a non-homologous chromosome, swapping with each other
Non-reciprocal translocation :: A chromosomal segment/nucleotide sequence is moved from a chromosome to a non-homologous chromosome, with no swapping with the sender

Point mutation :: A single substitution/deletion/insertion (INDELS) of one nucleotide in a gene

Why are there 64 possible codons yet only 20 amino acids?
?
Two reasons: 
1. Only 20 are needed to make all other types of amino acids
2. It provides a layer of redundancy (a primitive error-correction)
### Substitution mutations
Base-pair substitution :: Replaced a nucleotide (and it's pair) with another pair of nucleotides
Silent mutations :: The changing of a nucleotide with no effect as the encoded amino acid is the same (due to genetic redundancy)
Missense mutations :: The changing of a gene's nucleotide sequence where it does not code for the correct amino acid (e.g. `UUU=Phe` to `UAU=Tyr`)
Nonsense mutation :: The changing of an amino acid codon into a STOP codon

What do nonsense mutations lead to? :: Usually a non-functional protein as the protein is prematurely stopped from fully encoding
Are missense mutations always devastating? :: Not necessarily. If the altered amino acid is there for structure, likely not. If the altered amino acid is there for the active site of an enzyme, it would potentially disable it and therefore (potentially) be catastrophic.
What type of substitution mutation is sickle-cell anaemia? :: A missense (specifically a point) mutation (`GAG -> Glutamic acid` to `GTG -> Valine`)

### Insertions and Deletions
Why are insertions and deletions often more devastating than substitution mutations? :: Inserting and deleting can cause the entire polypeptide chain to be read completely wrong if the nucleotides weren't inserted/deleted in a multiple of three; frameshift mutation

Frameshift mutation :: The changing of the 'reading frame' in a nucleotide sequence (e.g. `GTT AGC` -> Add a `C` to the start -> `CGT TAG C`)
When nucleotides are inserted/deleted, what would the circumstances be to not produce a frameshift mutation? :: A frameshift would not happen if the nucleotides were inserted/deleted in a multiple of three; all/most of the information is there still
