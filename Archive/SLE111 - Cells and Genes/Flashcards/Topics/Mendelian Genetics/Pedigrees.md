# Types
### Recessive
- Must be recessive if there are two unaffected parents as there must be an affected parent to be dominant
	- One or both the parents are therefore carriers
###### X-Linked recessive
- An affected non-founding son with unaffected parents
	- A male can be affected by a single X-Linked recessive allele
		- But cannot be affected by a single autosomal allele
- May be where the son must have inherited the allele from only his mother and potentially unaffected father
######  Autosomal recessive
- Any affected founding **daughter** with two unaffected parents...
	- An affected individual must inherit a recessive allele from both parents (like `rr`)
- ...OR, an affected founding **son** has two unaffected parents AND both parents are unaffected carriers (otherwise, it's [[#X-Linked recessive]]) 
- If the father had of had a recessive X-Linked allele, he would have been affected


### Dominant
- Every child is affected from non-founding parents
- A child can not be affected by a sole autosomal recessive allele


### Maternal


### Figuring out a pedigree

- If both parents express the trait, then all their offspring should also express the trait
- If the offspring express the trait but their parents don't, then both parents are heterozygous
- If the offspring does not express the trait and one parent does, the offspring is heterozygous
###### Determine recessiveness or dominance
A parent **must** have a given trait to be dominant
If the parent does not have a trait but the child does (i.e. a generation is skipped), this must mean the trait is recessive
###### Determine if it's autosomal or sex-linked
Autosomal traits affect males and females in equal proportions while X-linked tend to affect males more than females

Fathers never share their X chromosome with sons, only daughters.
