## Probability
A dihybrid/multicharacter cross is equivalent to two or more independent monohybrid crosses
	- because of the law of independent assortment

What is the probability of the `YYRR` and `YyRR` genotypes using `YyRr`?

|     | Y   | y   |     |     | R   | r   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Y   | YY  | Yy  |     | R   | RR  | Rr  |
| y   | Yy  | yy  |     | r   | Rr  | rr  |
```
YY/RR = 1/4
yy/rr = 1/4
Yy/Rr = 1/2

YYRR -> 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 chance of YYRR
YyRR -> 1/2 * 1/4 = 1/8  chance of YyRR
```

Given `PpYyRr x Ppyyrr`, what fraction of this cross are predicted to exhibit the recessive phenotypes for at least two of the three characters?

Hetero x homozygous pairs -> probability = $\frac{1}{2}$

```
ppyyRr
ppYyrr
Ppyyrr
PPyyrr
ppyyrr
```
