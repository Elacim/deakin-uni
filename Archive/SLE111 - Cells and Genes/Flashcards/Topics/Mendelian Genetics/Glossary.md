Character ::: A heritable feature that varies among individuals, such as flower colour
Trait ::: Each variant for a character, such as purple or white colour for flowers - the observable phenotype
Allele :: Variants of a gene; specifiers of traits

Genotype ::: An organism's genetic makeup (e.g. `Pp & PP`)
Genotypic ratio :: The ratio of differing alleles (e.g. `1PP : 2Pp : 1pp`)
Phenotype ::: An organism's observable appearance and/or observable/physiological traits (e.g. `Pp & PP` making two purple plants)
Phenotypic ratio :: The ratio of the tabulating the end result of differing alleles (e.g. `2 purple : 1 white`, got from the genotypic ratio `1PP : 2Pp : 1pp`)

True/pure breeding organism :: An organism that is homozygous for an allele, and where the alleles will propagate throughout generations (i.e. self-fertilisation will always result in the same alleles)
Hybridisation :: The breeding of two true breeding organisms (e.g. `PP x pp`) to create a hybrid (`Pp`)

Polygenic :: One characteristic is controlled by two or more genes

Law of Segregation ::: Two alleles for a heritable character separate (segregate) during gamete formation and end up in differing gametes

Homozygous ::: Two identical alleles encoding a character across two different chromosomes 
Homozygote ::: An organism that is homozygous for a character
Heterozygous ::: Two differing alleles encoding a character across two different chromosomes
Heterozygote ::: An organism that is heterozygous for a character

Locus :: The specific position on a chromosome where a gene is located

Law of Independent Assortment :: Mendelâ€™s second law, stating that each pair of alleles segregates, or assorts, independently of each other pair during gamete formation; applies when genes for two characters are located on different pairs of homologous chromosomes or when they are far enough apart on the same chromosome to behave as though they are on different chromosomes
