- male gametophyte = pollen
- female gametophyte = ovule
- Fertilized cell grows into a seed

## Types of plants
###### Bryophytes (most fungi, some algae, mosses) - non-flowering plants
Sporophyte - lil dangly bits
Gametophyte - the moss itself
Antheridium :: The male sex organ in non-flowering plants
Archegonium :: The female sex organ in non-flowering plants
###### Gymnosperms ('naked seed') - Cones
Sporophyte - The tree -> pollen and cone scale ovules
Gametophytes - scaley pinecones and spongy pinecones  

both stages are multicellular

- Cones
	- Female: Looks like a pinecone. Ovules develop on cone scale surfaces
	- Male: Looks like a small, spongy pinecone (rods growing outwards). Pollen producer.
- adult plant can grow immediately from a seed
	- instead of a spore going through an intermediate gametophyte stage
- Water is (usually) not necessary for reproduction
- lodgepull pine has serotinous cones, only dropping their seeds when exposed to extreme heats (bushfires)
	- competition (other trees, underbrush) is taken out so the seeds have a higher chance of survival

###### Angiosperms ('container seed') - Flowering plants
Sporophyte - the plant (and flower?)
Gametophytes - pollen (male, anthers) and ovum (female, stigma-ovary) 

- instead of using the wind, they use animals (bees, mosquitoes etc.) to take pollen from male plants and fertilise female plants
	- mutualism
- flowers contain gametophytes (pollen/ovum)
- Sporophyte is the whole plant except the pollen and the ovum
- flowers can be female or male and fertilised even if the flowers are on the same plant
