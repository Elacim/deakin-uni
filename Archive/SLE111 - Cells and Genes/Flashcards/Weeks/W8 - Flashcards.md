Complete dominance :: Dominant allele is completely dominant over the recessive allele, i.e. if one dominant allele appears, the trait will always appear as that dominant allele
Mendelian genetics can be applied to every genetic situation :: No. While it mimics reality, it is not always correct
Polygenic :: One characteristic is controlled by two or more genes

Incomplete dominance :: Blending of traits (e.g. `M x N = O`)
When the phenotype of $F_{1}$ hybrids is somewhere between the phenotypes of the two parental varieties, such as red and white flowers mixing to become pink
Incomplete dominance examples
?
- Hypercholesterolemia - high cholesterol due to a lack of low density lipoproteins (LDLs) - `HH` = homozygous **ability** to make LDL receptors; `Hh` - mild disease; `hh` = homozygous **inability** to make LDL receptors

Co-dominance :: The heterozygote has a phenotype with both parental strains (e.g. `M x N = MN`)
What would happen if two dominant red and white flower colour alleles mixed? :: Both would show up, perhaps as white with red spots
Co-dominance examples
?
MN blood groups - both are present in heterozygous individuals
	$L^{m}L^{m}$ = m compound present on red blood cells
	$L^{m}L^{n}$ = m and n compound present on red blood cells
	$L^{n}L^{n}$ = n compound present on red blood cells
What are $L^{m}$ and $L^{n}$ examples of? :: MN blood groups (co-dominance)

Do most genes show up only in two allelic forms? :: Most genes exist in more than two allelic forms

Blood groups

| Phenotype | Genotype     | Genotype alt. |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| A         | $I^{A}I^{A}$ | $I^{A}i$      |
|           |              |               |
| B         | $I^{B}I^{B}$ | $I^{B}i$      |
| AB        | $I^{A}I^{B}$ |               |
| O         | $ii$         |               |
|           |              |               |
\+ and -  -> Rh factor (- has no factor)

What blood type is universally donatable? :: O-
Why is O- universally donatable? :: O- is universally donatable as it has no A/B or Rh factor to react to antigens
What blood type is universally accepted? :: AB+
Why is AB+ universally accepted? :: AB+ is universally accepted as it has A, B, and a positive Rh factor, meaning antigens in a receiver will not 

What is agglutination? :: The clumping together of red blood cells or bacteria
What happens when blood groups conflict? :: The body releases an anti-A/B/+ antigen (e.g. anti-A antigen) which causes agglutination 
When blood groups conflict (A in B or anything like that), the blood releases the appropriate anti-x antigen (e.g. anti-A antigen). 
What does it mean if blood agglutinates when donating blood? :: The donating blood type is **not** compatible with the host's blood type
What does it mean if blood does *not* agglutinate when donating blood? :: The donating blood **is** compatible with the host's blood type

Pleiotropy :: A property where genes with multiple phenotypic effects
What can result from pleiotropy? :: Hereditary diseases such as cystic fibrosis and sickle-cell disease

Sickle cell disease - slide 8a

Epistasis :: Where the phenotypic expression of one gene alters that of another independently inherited gene
Epistasis example :: Coat colour (one determines pigment colour while the other determines whether pigment is deposited in the hair) 
True or False: An recessive gene can override the final product of a heterozygous organism (e.g. `Bbee`) :: True. The `Bb` allele will make the dog brown but because the `ee` alleles control the pigment deposition, the end result would be blond (lack of pigment)

Polygenic inheritance :: 
Quantitative characters :: Phenotypic characters that vary in the population in gradations along the continuum and not in an either/or manner
What does quantitative variation suggest? :: Polygenic inheritance (an additive effect of 2+ genes on a single phenotype)
What does a bell-curve distribution suggest? :: That the phenotypes are controlled by polygenic inheritance


### Environmental factors
Nature vs. nurture
Norm of reaction :: The phenotypic range of a genotype influenced by the environment
What is the amount of red blood cells dependent on? :: The amount of iron in a person's diet and the amount of oxygen available (affected by factors like altitude which increase the amount of cells)
What is the effect of altitude on red blood cell count? :: The higher the altitude, the more red blood cells. This is to make up for the lack of oxygen and leads to thick blood

How does acidity affect hydrangea colour? :: Alkaline soil makes the flowers pinker, while acidic soil makes the flowers bluer (aluminium content also affects colour/intensity)
What is an environmental factor? :: Any change in living that may cause a change in phenotypic expression



Do sex chromosomes only affect gender-specific characters? :: No.
Sex-linked gene :: Gene located on either sex chromosome
X-linked gene :: A gene on the (larger) X-chromosome
Y-linked :: A gene on the Y-chromosome

What are the conditions needed for recessive X-linked traits to be expressed? :: A female needs two copies of the allele vs a male needing only one copy
X-linked recessive disorders are much more common in males than females :: True. A male only needs one copy of an allele, while a female would need two
X-linked recessive chromosome disorders :: Colour blindness, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, haemophilia
Why are more males (~$\frac{1}{12}$) colourblind than females (~$\frac{1}{200}$) :: x-linked shenanigans

Maternal inheritance :: Also known as cytoplasmic inheritance, these are characters inherited through the maternal line via the mitochondria (mitochondrial DNA)
How is mitochondrial DNA transferred from generation to generation? :: From mothers; all siblings (female and male) will have the same mDNA

Is haemophilia X-linked recessive? :: Yes.

## Pedigrees
What is a pedigree? :: A family tree that describes the inter-relationships of parents and offspring across generations
What can pedigrees be used for? :: They can be used to make predictions about future offspring
Pedigree: What does a **square** represent? :: Males
Pedigree: What does a **circle** represent? :: Females
Pedigree: What does a fully coloured shape represent? :: An affected individual
Pedigree: What does a half-coloured shape represent? :: A carrier
True or false: Carriers are always shown on pedigrees :: False. They may not be displayed and it is safer to assume they are **not** going to be shown.
Autosomal trait :: Non-sex chromosome linked traits

##### Recessive disorders
How are most genetic disorders inherited? :: Recessively
True or false: For a genetic disorder to be active, the allele must be homozygous :: True.
Carriers :: Heterozygous individuals who carry the recessive allele but are phenotypically normal

Cystic Fibrosis
Sickle-cell disease (slide 3b)

#### Recessive, dominant, or autosomal?
If a trait skips a generation in a pedigree, it must be a {{recessive}} trait :: Recessive tratit.
If both parents have the trait, {{all}} offspring will have the trait :: All offspring will have the trait.
If an equal number of females:males are affected, it is likely {{autosomal}} {{recessive}} :: Autosomal recessive
If a lot more males have a trait than girls, and it is a recessive trait, it is likely that the trait is {{X-linked}} {{recessive}} :: X-linked recessive
If the trait is X-linked recessive and a girl has the trait, her {{father}} must also have the trait and her {{mother}} must be a {{carrier}} :: ...her **father** must also have the trait and her **mother** must be a **carrier**

Dominant traits
Achondroplasia :: A form of dwarfism that is lethal when the dominant allele is homozygous
If a trait does not skip a generation, it must be a {{dominant}} trait :: Dominant trait
If two affected parents have an unaffected child, it must be {{dominant}} :: Dominant. This is due to recessive genes. `Tt x Tt -> 1/4 are tt`

X-linked dominant trait (fathers will pass it onto all of their daughters)
In autosomal dominant, fathers pass equally since they're not tied to sex chromosomes
Y-linked traits will always be passed from {{father}} {{to}} {{son}} :: Father to son
Why can't Y-linked traits be passed onto daughters? :: Females have two X chromosomes and therefore will never have a Y-chromosome which means they will never have a Y-linked trait

What is maternal inheritance? :: Also known as mitochondrial inheritance, it is the passing of traits from a mother to all her offspring; both sons and daughters will be affected by only daughters will pass on the trait
What is another name for maternal inheritance? ::: What is another name for mitochondrial inheritance?

True or False: Males are more susceptible to X-linked recessive disorders :: True. Females would need to have both copies of the recessive allele for it to show through

### Analysing a pedigree
Determining pedigrees: Does every affected individual have an affected parent (i.e. does it skip a generation)? :: No - recessive; Yes - inconclusive
Determining pedigrees: If both parents are affected, are all children affected? :: No - dominant; yes - inconclusive
Determining pedigrees: Are there equal numbers of affected males : females? :: Yes - autosomal; No - X-linked

A male with an X-linked dominant trait will have... :: All daughters affected and no sons affected
A male with an X-linked recessive trait will have... :: Only some granddaughters affected while daughters are carriers
A female with an X-linked recessive trait will have... :: No daughters affected (`XX -> Xx`) - dominant `X` overrides `x` and all sons affected (`XY` -> `XY`)
A male with a Y-linked trait will have :: All sons affected and no daughters ever affected
Is Y-linked recessive possible? :: Technically yes. Y-linked recessive is an extreme case (probably the only situation is with a XYY set of sex chromosomes). 
A female with a maternally linked trait will have... :: All children affected with all daughters passing it to all their children


### Linked Genes
True or false: Each chromosome has hundreds-thousands of genes :: True.
What are linked genes? :: Genes that are located close on the chromosome and may be inherited together
Do linked genes sort independently or dependently? :: They sort dependently as they are on the same chromosome close together
Do linked genes show different inheritance patterns to non-linked genes? :: Yes.
What is the effect of linked genes on phenotypes? :: They limit the number of possible phenotypes
	- parental are present more often than non-linked
e.g. Fly body colour and wing size are inherited together
	- Large number of flies with parental phenotype
	- Linked genes do not sort independently and are on the same chromosome
Crossing over:
	- flies that didn't look like either parent (potentially due to crossing over)
	- portion of maternal x paternal chromatid in the homologous chromosome
		- results in new combos of alleles within chromosomes
Unlinked genes are either on separate chromosomes or far apart on the same chromosomes, sorting independently
Recombinant offspring :: Offspring that shows new combinations of parental traits
What does it mean when 50% of offspring being recombinants :: There is a 50% frequency of recombination (Slide 20a)
What does 50% apparent recombination indicate? :: That they independently assort and are on separate chromosomes (it being over 50% would mean the gene is displaced off the chromosome which is impossible)

## Linkage maps
slide 20b
What is a linkage map? :: A genetic map of a chromosome based on recombination frequencies
What is crossing over used for in linkage maps? :: It is used as a measure of genetic distance
The percentage of of offspring showing genetic recombination can be used to determine what? :: They are an indication of number of map units separating the two gene loci
What is 1 map unit equivalent to? :: 1% in recombination frequency
What is 1% in recombination frequency equivalent to? :: 1 map unit
What do map units indicate? ::: Indication of the relative distance and order, not precise location of genes
If a gene is over 40 map units away from another gene, is it linked or unlinked? :: Unlinked. When crossing over occurs, it is unlikely to be crossed over together with the >40 map unit gene

When crossing `CcDd x ccdd`, we obtain \[`40% ccDd`, `40% ccdd`, `10% Ccdd`, and `10% ccDd`\]. How do we determine what gene loci to focus on? :: We determine it from the offspring, `ccdd` and `Ccdd`
When crossing `CcDd x ccdd`, we obtain \[`40% ccDd`, `40% ccdd`, `10% Ccdd`, and `10% ccDd`\]. How many map units apart are these two gene loci? :: First of all, the two loci are the offspring (`Ccdd` and `ccDd`). As they each have a map unit of `10%`, we add them up to find that they are 20 map units apart and are therefore linked
```
CcDd x ccdd

Parental: CcDd (40%) and ccdd (40%)
Recombinant: Ccdd (10%) and ccDd (10%)
-> Ccdd + ccDd = 20%
Ccdd and ccDd are 20 map units apart, therefore they are linked as they are under the 40 map unit threshold
```
