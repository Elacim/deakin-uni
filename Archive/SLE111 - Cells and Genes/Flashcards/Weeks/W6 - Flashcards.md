What is genetics the study of? :: Heredity and variation
Heredity ::  transmission of traits, generation-generation
Variation :: differences in appearance that offspring show (parents, siblings)

Gene :: A segment of DNA
Allele :: 
Gamete :: Sperms or eggs
Zygote :: Sperm fused into an egg
Haploid number :: The pair count of chromosomes
Meiosis is reductive :: True. Produces haploid gametes
Meiosis halves the number of chromosomes in a daughter cell :: True. 
Gametes are diploid :: False. They are the only haploid cells within the body.
If a gamete has 22 autosomes and an X chromosome, what is the gamete? :: Either a sperm or an egg cell

What sex chromosome(s) come from unfertilized eggs (ovum)? :: Only $X$ chromosomes
What sex chromosome(s) come from sperm cells? :: $X$ or $Y$
Reproductive tissues :: Ovary and testes
Where are gametes produced? :: In the respective reproductive tissues

Somatic cell :: Body cell (non-reproductive cells)
Haploid :: Two pairs of chromosomes
How many individual chromosomes does a human have? :: 46
How many pairs of chromosomes does a human have? :: 23
How many sex chromosomes does a human have? :: 1 pair (2 individual) - XX or XY

How are chromosomes classified :: Relative size and centromere location
How do chromosomes pair up? :: Through size and level of matching

How are chromosomes of an organism visualised? :: Karyotype

Homologous chromosomes 
 - one chromosome from each parent

A nucleus containing half the number of chromosomes as a single body cell :: Haploid

# Meiosis
What is meiosis? :: The production of 4 genetically unique haploid daughter cells from 1 parent cell

## Parental Investment
