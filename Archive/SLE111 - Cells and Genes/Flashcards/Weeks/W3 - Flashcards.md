Motility :: Genetically determined movement ability of an organism
### Cytoskeleton
Cytoskeleton structural components :: Microtubules, intermediate filaments, and microfilaments 
Microtubules :: 25nm wide hollow tubes made of tubulin; important for cell shape, organelle movement, and mitotic spindle formation; biggest cytoskeleton structure
Intermediate filaments :: 8-12nm rope-like rods; important for reinforcement; second largest cytoskeleton structure; examples are nails, hair, and the inner lining of the nuclear envelope
Microfilaments :: 7nm wide strings made of the protein actin; important for cell movement and shapeshifting
Actin :: Protein that microfilaments and muscle fibrils are comprised of
Tubulin :: Protein that vitally important microtubules are comprised of 

Cytoskeleton plays an important role in organelle translocation :: True. Organelles are evenly distributed to allow each part of a cell to have an even amount of product

Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide enter/leave a cell via {{passive transport}} :: Passive transport. Passive because the Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide are tiny.
Osmosis :: Movement of water from a hypotonic -> hypertonic environment through a semi-permeable membrane

Exocytosis :: Internal to external. Exo - exit. e.g. hormones being released from an endocrine cell.
Endocytosis :: External to internal. Endo - 'within'

Why is a cell more negative on the inside than the external environment? :: A cell wants to maintain a negative energy so they can use the potential energy to do stuff
Action potential :: An action potential is **a rapid sequence of changes in the voltage across a membrane**. The membrane voltage, or potential, is determined at any time by the relative ratio of ions, extracellular to intracellular, and the permeability of each ion.

### [[Flagella & Cilia]]
Centrosome :: Separates chromosomes
Basal-body :: The start of a flagella/cilia

Flagella and cilia are made up of inner and outer {{dynein arms}}, {{doublet microtubules}}, and a {{membrane}} :: Dynein arms, doublet microtubules, and a membrane
A 9+0 or 9-0 arrangement of a flagellum's structure means what? :: That the flagellum's structure is comprised of only an outer membrane and a ring of 9 microtubular doublets +0 inner microtubule pairs


### Joining cells
Intercellular junctions :: Ways that cells interact with each other through direct contact. Animal cells have gap junctions, tight junctions, and desmosomes, whereas plant cells have plasmodesmata [Source - LibreText ('Connections between Cells and Cellular Activity')](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_1e_(OpenStax)/2%3A_The_Cell/04%3A_Cell_Structure/4.6%3A__Connections_between_Cells_and_Cellular_Activities)
Tight junctions :: Animal cells are sealed and bound together by proteins occludins (stability; barrier function) and claudins (forms barriers; permeability), preventing extracellular leakage; think of it as glue
Desmosomes :: Animal cell exclusive. Welds cells together with lots of hair -like cadherin proteins, forming a stretchy sheet when multiple cells are welded; think of it as welding
Gap junctions :: A gap in a cell made of connexins used for transporting nutrients and energy between cells
Plasmodesmata :: Plant cell exclusive. Plasma membrane lined channels (holes) within a plant cell that allow small resources like water, sugars, or amino acids to flow between neighbouring cells; 'pla' = plant cell [[Campbell Biology_ Australian an - Lisa A Urry -exclude.pdf#page=607|Source - Textbook (page 607)]]
Desmosomes vs tight junctions :: Desmosomes weld cells together with hair-like proteins whereas tight junctions hold and seal the cell membranes together with grouped up proteins 

### [[Plasma membrane]]
Plasma membrane structure :: Phospholipids pointing towards each other. In and on the sides of the membrane are proteins, carbohydrates, and cholesterol
What are the purposes of a cell's plasma membrane? :: It prevents the cell from spilling out it's contents; structure; controls molecular traffic; cell-cell recognition; intercellular joining; pathogenic protection
What is the electric charge within a cell? :: There is a net negative charge within the cell

Purpose of cholesterol :: Maintains membrane stability, keeping the membrane from falling apart due to heat and crystallising due to cold
Can plasma membranes flex? :: Yes, they can flex, rotate, and drift laterally 
Effect of coldness on lipid membranes :: They become less fluid, huddling the lipids and eventually crystallising them. 
Effect of heat on lipid membranes :: They become more fluid, distancing the lipids from each other.
Do lipids have to match each other exactly 1:1? :: No, they can be fairly loose with 
how central they are.
In normal circumstances, do lipids ever flip? :: No. They stay phospholipid head outwards, fatty acid tail inwards unless specific cases permit

Saturated fat effects :: They cause membrane fluidity to go down as lipids are closer together due to straight fatty acid tails
Unsaturated fat effects :: They cause membrane fluidity to increase as lipids are further apart due to kinked fatty acid tails
Saturated vs unsaturated fats
?
**Saturated:** Straight tailed; solid at room temperature; animal fats; less fluid membrane
**Unsaturated:** Kinked tail; liquid at room temperature; plant/fish fats; more fluid membrane

Do proteins move as lipids move? :: no
Integral protein :: A protein embedded in the plasma membrane end-to-end
Peripheral protein :: A protein embedded on the outside of the plasma membrane (in or on one side)

Names for the inner and outer sides of the plasma membrane :: *Intracellular* (cytoplasmic side) and *extracellular* (outside the cell)
<!--SR:!2023-08-02,4,270-->

Extracellular matrix (ECM) :: 

Types of proteins embedded in the membrane :: Transport, enzyme, signal transduction (signal cascades), cell-cell recognition, intercellular joining, attachment to cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix


### Origins of life
When is life estimated to have started? :: About 4 billion years ago (4bya) as the Earth's crust cooled
<!--SR:!2023-08-02,4,270-->
How long were [[Prokaryotes]] dominant for? :: ~2by, given by ~3.5bya Stromatolite evidence in ancient sedimentary rocks
<!--SR:!2023-08-02,4,270-->
Possible origins of life :: Chemical evolution, outer space, deep sea

Biogenesis :: The hypothesis that life only comes from life.

What materials where thought to have helped organic monomers form larger molecules? :: Lava, rock, and/or clay
How did heat (likely) allow higher concentrations of monomers on the Earth's surface? :: The $H_{2}O$ evaporated 
<!--SR:!2023-08-02,4,270-->
First cells :: [[Prokaryotes]] - bacteria and archaea were the first cells
Deep sea vents :: A possible precursor to life. Ancient bacteria may have resided in the sulfur and iron rich vents.
<!--SR:!2023-08-01,3,250-->
What was the early atmosphere comprised of? :: Primarily Nitrogen and Carbon Dioxide

Abiotic :: Without, or the absence of life
Protobiont :: Abiotically produced molecules being the precursors to living cells. They maintained an internal environment which was different to the external.
