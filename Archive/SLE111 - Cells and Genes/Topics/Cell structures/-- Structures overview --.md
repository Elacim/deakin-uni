Some species of plant can have sperm with [[Flagella & Cilia|flagella.]]


#### [[Nucleus]]
Encloses chromatin - long fibres of DNA. Chromatin coils up into chromosomes during cell division
	- Chromosomes allow our ~1.6m DNA to fit in a cell
Ribosomes are made in the nucleolus
Nuclear membrane is a double membrane w/ pores
![[Organelle-nucleus.jpg|200]]

#### [[Cytoplasm]]
- Region between nucleus and  plasma membrane
- bulk of most cells
- mainly water and dissolved salts
- Contains
	- proteins (shuttling molecules between organelles)
	- Enzymes (breaking down/synthesising cytoplasmic molecules)
	- Enzymes (signalling)
	- Cytoplasmic molecules building blocks (e.g. amino acids, glucose)
	- Nucleic acids (e.g. tRNA)

[[Cell wall]]

[[Plasma membrane]]

#### Endomembrane system
'Endo' means 'inside'
Some organelle membranes are continuous
Others exchange sacs full of membrane (budding and fusion of vesicles)
Organelles -
	Nuclear membrane
	Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)
	Golgi Apparatus
	Lysosomes 
	Vacuoles

#### [[Ribosomes ]]
- Made in the nucleus
	- Exported via nuclear pores 
- Participates in translation (protein production)
- Can exist in cytoplasm/bound to ER
- Cells w/ high rate of protein synthesis will tend to contain many ribosomes


## [[Endoplasmic Reticulum]]
###### Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (Rough ER)
- Ribosomes all in it's folds
- Site of synthesis of membrane-bound proteins & secreted proteins
	- Ribosomes place protein into ER where a vesicle buds off
- Continuous w/ nuclear envelope

###### Smooth (Smooth ER)
- Tubular structure continuous w/ rough ER
- Site of new membrane (lipid) synthesis
- Cell type specific functions
	- Endrocrine (hormones)
	- Liver cells (drug detox)
	- Muscle cells (stores calcium)

#### [[Golgi apparatus]]
- stacks aren't interconnected
- modifies protein sugars
- Receiving side - accepts transport vesicles from rough ER
- Shipping side - forms transport vesicles for transporting out plasma membrane/organelle
- High protein production and secretion - lots of golgi stacks

#### [[Lysosomes ]]
- Vesicles containing digestive enzymes
- These can digest food vacuoles
- Destroy engulfed bacteria in white blood cells (WBC)
- Recycle (think of it as a recycling centre) worn out organelles/cell [[Macromolecules]] 

- Pompe's disesase (glycogen storage) - convert from glucose-glycogen but can't break it back down into glucose
- Tay-Sachs disease (lipid disorder) - similar to Pompe's. Has a lot of side effects.

#### [[Vacuoles]]
- Primarily storage
	- Seed nutrients
	- Flower pigments
	- Toxic metabolic waste product
	- Chemical defences/poisons
- Growth
	- Expansion reduces cytoplasm volume
		- Allows plant cells to grow

## Energy 
Both chloroplasts and mitochondria are believed to have evolved from
endosymbiotsis of prokaryotes. They have their own genetic material and most perform [[Binary Fission|binary fission.]] 
Endosymbiont theory - 1967?
#### [[Chloroplasts]] 
- believed to have
- plant cells can mostly recycle energy -> waste -> energy etc.
- photosynthesis
- Makeup
	- Inter-membrane system
	- Stroma (thick fluid)
	- Granum (stacks of tubes and discs called thylakoids containing chlorophyll)

![[Organelle-chloroplast.webp|400]]


#### [[Mitochondria]]
- Glucose to make ATP (chemical energy to energy)
- across vast majority of eukaryotes
- Cellular respiration
	- Double membranes - Cristae (folded in an inner membrane), increases surface area
	- 2 compartments (inter-membrane space and matrix)
-
