Characteristics of life:
	- highly ordered
	- organised into cells
	- able to reproduce
		- using own cellular material
	- able to grow and develop
	- requires energy & nutrients
	- responds to their environment
	- evolve & adapt to environment
	- store and transmit 

Virus - not living as it needs a vector to reproduce.

Biosphere -> Ecosystems -> Communities -> Populations -> Organisms -> Organs and Organ systems -> Tissues -> Cells -> Organelles -> Molecules -> Atoms

**B**iosphere - any environment is habitable by life (bodies of water, ocean, land, deserts, jungles etc.). 
**E**cosystems - all living organisms and other non-living entities (dead trees, viruses, air, water, soil, light, environment etc.) things interacting in a location. Physical environment.
**C**ommunities - 'all populations of all species occupying a given area'
**P**opulation - a group of any living things (plants, fungi, animals, bacteria) of one species type located in a given area
**M**ulticellular Organisms - one specific species within a space, made up of a large quantity of different types of cells
**O**rgan systems - The interaction of organs physically or chemically to perform a common task (such as the brain communicating to the liver to produce more bile)
**O**rgans - 2+ tissues to perform a common task
**T**issue - Organised arrays of cells that interact for a specific task
**C**ell - The smallest unit of life capable of surviving and reproducing on it's own
**O**rganelles - the components of cells (mitochondria, ribosomes)
**M**olecule - Two or more atoms bonded together
**A**tom - The smallest unit that retains an elements properties

Cells are the smallest fundamental unit of life - bacteria are a type of cell. 

###### Binomial nomenclature
1.5 million species of animals (less than 20% of all *living* species)
Formal naming:
	- better communication between scientists speaking any language
	- Derived from Carl Linnaeus in 1700s
	- e.g. A dog's scientific name is *Canis familiaris*

Naming format:\<Genus> \<species>
	-Genus is capitalised, species is all lowercase 
	-Italicise digitally, underline in handwriting
	-Naming is latinised
	-If species is unknown, then write '*sp.*' after genus
	-If a sub-species, simply add it on

Species - most specific

Atoms
	- Matter: Mass & takes up space
	- Solid/Liquid/Gas
	- Element - substance that can't be broken down further with *chemical reactions*

1st orbital - 2 electrons
2nd orbital - 8 electrons
3rd orbital - 8 electrons

The count of valence shell electrons determines the group the element is in on the periodic table. Valence means how many electrons it would take to fill the outermost shell of an atom's orbital
```
Hydrogen - valence of 1
Oxygen - valence of 2
Nitrogen - valence of 3
Carbon - valence of 4
This means that hydrogen can form 1 bond, oxygen 2 bonds, etc.
```
25 elements are essential to life
	- very important: carbon, oxygen nitrogen, hydrogen etc.
	- lesser so: magnesium, chlorine etc.
	- trace: zinc

Compounds can lead to very different results (H = explosive, O = flammable, H${_2}$O = water, putting out fires)

2+ atoms -> molecule, lots of simple molecules -> macromolecule

List of bonds this unit will cover:
	- Ionic bond (total electron transfer)
		- e.g. Na + Cl -> Na${^+}$Cl${^-}$ -> NaCl
			- Na is the cation, Cl is the anion
	- Covalent bonds (electron sharing)
		- 2 atoms sharing 1+ outer shell electrons
		- Oxygen to hydrogen atoms
		- Valency indicates the # of possible covalent bonds
	- Hydrogen bonds (electrical attractions)
		- Weak electrical attractions between opposite poles
			- Water has a + & - end (poles), the hydrogens will be attracted on either end to other water molecules
		- Intramolecular -> between same molecule species
		- Inter -> between different molecular species

Water -> 75-95% of cellular content
	- medium where biochemical reactions occur
	- molecules need to be polar/ionic to be soluble in water
	- is a polar solvent
	- water is polar because oxygen is slightly negative and hydrogen slightly positive

Charged ions dissolve in water when a hydration shell is formed (water surrounds the ion)
Non-polar covalent bonds (oil) do not dissolve in water

pH - acidity measuring
	- pH = -log\[$H{^+}$]
	- 0-14 (acidic to alkaline)
	- Acids are ionic that release hydrogen ions (H${+}$) in water (0-7)
	- Bases are ionic that release hydroxyl ions (OH${^-}$) in water (7-14)
	- Molecules with a pH of 7 are neutral
	- Changes in H+ and OH- can drastically affect a cell

'-ide' means negatively charged 

Macromolecules - thousands-millions of covalently bonded atoms
	- Polymer -> many similar building blocks
		- Monomer -> a single building block
	-Carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids (all true polymers), and lipids (non-polymer)
	
Carbon skeletons
Build a polymer chain using a dehydration reaction
Break a chain using hydrolysis ('lysis' meaning to destroy)

Carbohydrates - sugars (monosaccharides) and polymers of sugars (polysaccharides)
	- Glucose (monosaccharide)
		- Major source of energy
		- Builds up to the important starch (energy storage), glycogen, and cellulose (structural form - cell walls in plants)
	- Disaccharide -> 2 monosaccharides joined together through a dehydration reaction

Lipids - hydrophobic (fats, cholesterol, sex hormones, cell membranes). 
	- Made of glycerol and tail made of fatty acids
	- Phospholipid (hydrophillic head, hydrophobic tail -> meaning they're amphipathic)
		- Self assemble in water
			- Micelle (a circle of phospholipids)
			- Phospholipid bilayer
	- Saturation
		- Saturated: Tail is single bonds (straight). Solid at room temp. Tends to come from animals.
			- SSS - *S*aturated, *s*traight tail, *s*olid at room temp.
		- Unsaturated: Mostly single then a double bond kinks it. Liquid at room temp. Tends to be from plant fats and fish fats.
	- Major function of fats is energy storage
		- Stored in adipose cells
		- Cushions vital organs + insulates the body

Proteins - wide range of functions
	- Building blocks (monomers) are called amino acids
		- Sequence determines shape, and therefore the function	
 - Structural, storage, contractile (muscle contractions), transport (haemoglobin), hormonal, receptor, defensive
- 20 essential amino acids
- Structure
	- 1. Primary structure (amino acid strings)
	- 2. Secondary (alpha helix, beta pleated sheet)
	- 3. Tertiary (polypeptide)
	- 4. Quaternary (complete protein)
	
Nucleic acid - DNA & RNA
	- Built from nucleotides
	- Store and transmit info (in the form of genes)
	- Protein synthesis
	- Made up of nucleotides
		- Phosphate - sugar - base
			- sugar = deoxyribose
			- phosphate and sugar form backbone
			- base is one of TA GC
				- Thymine and Adenine pair up
				- Guanine and Cytosine pair up
	- RNA - ribose, not deoxyribose
		- uracil instead of thymine (U instead of T)
		- single stranded
		- mRNA (messenger RNA) takes genetic info from DNA to ribosome
		- DNA -> mRNA -> RNA -> Protein
	- Transcription: DNA to mRNA
	- Translation: mRNA to polypeptide chain
	- 3 nucleotides encodes one amino acid
