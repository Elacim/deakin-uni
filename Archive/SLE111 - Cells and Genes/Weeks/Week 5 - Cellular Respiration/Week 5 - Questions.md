Is the Kreb's cycle's main purpose setup for the ETC? Yes. - interchanges - electron carriers

Last lesson you said something about some molecule (pyruvate?) being converted to $NADH \text{ OR } FADH_2$, with $NADH$ providing the most ATP-per. How is the NADH picked over FADH and vice-versa? 
Different shuttles - NADh can't cross

Also is NADH an enzyme?

$NADH$ and $FADH_{2}$ produced ATP? 

With ETC, why do we need to push the $H^{+}$ out to generate energy? I don't really know how, but wouldn't using the molecules and doing something like hydrolysis potentially produce the same amount of energy? 
Form of cotransport - H+ charge has potential. Not enough energy present w/o

Also, with ATP's 'energy', what does that mean exactly? Is it heat, electrons, electric field? 
Heat and light 


Quick runthrough of cellular division
Metabolic interchanges?
